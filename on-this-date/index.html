              <p>
                As I was stuck in bed again today, I decided to indulge in one
                of my favorite pastimes where I go back through my photo
                archives and check out what was happening on that day&#8217;s
                date in years gone by. One of the reasons that it is such a
                bummer to be sick right now is because this is a truly excellent
                time of year to be observing wildlife — especially in the world
                of spiders and insects. Apparently, May 19, 2009 was an
                especially good day for this, and I thought I would share just a
                small fraction of the arthropods I photographed.

                <p>
                  Sometimes it feels as though my entire life is on the
                  &#8220;nerdy-insect-lover&#8221; side of things, but I say
                  there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that! Sure, my friends and
                  family thought it was a little weird when I was first getting
                  into insects about three years ago, but at this point in the
                  game I think my passion for insects has made them all slightly
                  more tolerant and respectful of them. I know that I for one
                  will always look forward to your bug images, Harsi (but you
                  already knew that) 🙂 Seems like May 19th 09 was a pretty good
                  date for bugs! Many of these I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve
                  seen yet. I can&#8217;t help you with the spider, I
                  don&#8217;t know too much about widows&#8230; all I know is
                  that brown widows, black widows, and false black widows all
                  reside around my home, and since I can&#8217;t really tell
                  them apart, I prefer to give them their space.

                  Chris&#8230; I had you in mind with this post! I wasn&#8217;t
                  sure if anyone else would be thrilled by seeing so many
                  arthropods, but I figured I&#8217;d have at least one fan.
                  (Well, that&#8217;s not entirely fair, Ruth is also a BugGuide
                  contributor and she is always interested in learning more. 🙂
                  I think for me, the writing was probably on the wall even when
                  I was quite young. My parents like to tell me the stories of
                  when I used to visit the Smithsonian Museum at 3 or 4 years
                  old and hold the large hissing cockroaches and millipedes. (I
                  gather it freaked people out a bit to see a chubby-cheeked
                  little girl gleefully holding such insects!) As I got older, I
                  could never understand why people were squeamish about
                  insects&#8230; and more importantly, I could not comprehend
                  their irrational desire to squash everything that happened to
                  cross their path. Like you, Chris, I&#8217;d like to believe
                  that my interest in insects has had a positive impact on those
                  closest to me. My husband no longer squishes anything (other
                  than the occasional mosquito, ant or flea)&#8230; instead, he
                  yells from wherever he is in the house &#8212; &#8220;Hon,
                  I&#8217;ve got something for you to rescue.&#8221; OK, so,
                  he&#8217;s not too keen to know anything about them, or handle
                  them himself&#8230; but, at least he&#8217;s more (as you
                  said) &#8220;tolerant&#8221;. 🙂 Other family members and
                  friends often send me photos or call me with descriptions of
                  bugs they&#8217;ve seen &#8212; I love being able to help them
                  identify things and wherever possible, I try to inject a bit
                  of good PR and some factoids. I give all the Latrodectus a
                  wide berth too&#8230; I confess that I still feel I am in the
                  infancy of my understanding of spider ID, but I just recently
                  got a copy of this book which I&#8217;m hoping will help:

                <p>
                  I think when I was a kid I was a lot like you; insects, and
                  all other animals for that matter, were interesting, and I
                  spent a lot of time outdoors so they were just a part of life,
                  and I enjoyed learning about them. From my experience I think
                  this is the norm for a lot of kids, but what happened to me,
                  and what I think happens with a lot of people, is that society
                  (be it our parents, friends, etc) subconsciously teach us for
                  some reason or another to be fearful of insects. The insects
                  that get the most attention seem to be the harmful ones,
                  giving the entire group a bad rap. I&#8217;m not sure when it
                  happened with me, but past early childhood most of my life I
                  lived in a sort of insect &#8220;dark ages,&#8221;
                  irrationally afraid of any small multilegged creature. It
                  wasn&#8217;t until about three years ago when a wildlife
                  biology course forced me to get up close and personal with
                  insects did I finally again remember, &#8220;hey! these things
                  aren&#8217;t so bad&#8221; and ever since then I&#8217;ve been
                  trying to spread the message 🙂 Harsi, you&#8217;ll have to
                  tell me of that spider book is any good; my arachnid
                  literature collection is, well&#8230; nonexistant. But
                  hopefully that can change soon.

                <p>
                  Wow&#8230; so interesting to hear about your insect
                  &#8220;dark ages&#8221;. I agree with what you wrote and think
                  this is true for so many kids. It seems like such a shame that
                  they get so much negative input about insects early on &#8212;
                  butterflies and ladybugs being the consistent exception to the
                  rule. 🙂 It pains me to hear so many young people write ALL
                  insects off as &#8220;icky&#8221; or, worse still,
                  aggressively seek to obliterate any small thing that they see
                  crawling near them. I think a lot of that is, as you say,
                  conditioning from parents and older siblings. This is one of
                  the reasons that I always relish the opportunity to spend time
                  with kids and try to change the way they think about these
                  things&#8230; then, maybe THEY can teach their families a
                  thing or two. 🙂 It sounds as though you are on the same page
                  with me, Chris, and I&#8217;m so very glad that you found your
                  way back to appreciating these marvelous creatures. I will
                  indeed let you know about the spider book once I&#8217;ve had
                  a chance to familiarize myself a bit&#8230; for my birthday, I
                  also got this excellent textbook which you may be familiar
                  with:
