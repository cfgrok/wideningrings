              <p>
                I&#8217;ve been struggling to finish up the next installment of
                my retrospective on our trip to Washington last month. (Not
                struggling because it is unenjoyable, but because I can&#8217;t
                seem to decide which images to share&#8230; I&#8217;m terrible
                like that when it comes to making up my mind.) Meanwhile, ever
                since we returned home, the lure to be outside for large
                portions of the day grows stronger and stronger. Spring is in
                full swing and the sight of deer peeking out of tall grasses and
                the sounds of birds singing their best courtship arias are hard
                things to resist. (Not to mention the bevy of awesome insects
                that have arrived and promise a new discovery nearly every
                day!!) I promised myself that I wouldn&#8217;t share any of my
                recent pics until I&#8217;d finished with the tales of our trip
                — BUT WHO AM I KIDDING??? Some things just need to be
                shared&#8230; especially with friends. I hope you enjoy and be
                sure to click on the images for embiggened viewing!

                  are one of my favorite annual phenomena. Though they live in
                  the area year-round, they are only easily observable at the
                  end of Winter and through Spring when they leave their moist
                  terrestrial hide-outs to congregate in the seasonal creek and
                  breed. As they are extremely toxic, the adults have very few
                  known predators, but

                  predatory mosquitofish, crayfish, and bullfrogs, which eat the
                  non-poisonous larvae and eggs. Breeding ponds have been
                  destroyed for development, and stream pools used for breeding
                  have been destroyed by sedimentation caused by

                have the time to appreciate all the wonders it has to offer. And

                wet weather, may the anticipation make its arrival all the
                sweeter.

                  Fantastic shots of Spring. That little newt is quite amazing.
                  And the red sunset is really unbelievable. We don&#8217;t get
                  sunsets like that out here in NY, some nice deep oranges and
                  purple but rarely a dark red like that. That would stop me in
                  my tracks as well. Lucky that you had your camera with you,
                  although I imagine you almost always have it with you these
                  days. Good thing. 🙂 B

                  Awww, thanks so much for the nice words, Ben. The newts are
                  indeed amazing and the kid in me just wants to pick them up
                  and pet them &#8212; good thing the grown-up in me understands
                  that they are lethally toxic! Hmmm&#8230; the sunset was
                  supposed to look hot pink&#8230; I guess monitor colors really
                  do vary widely, eh? *grin* Nevertheless, it was spectacular
                  and we do sometimes get skies that are deep red (usually just
                  as the sun is about to slip below the horizon). Yes, I try to
                  take my camera with me whenever I go out for a walk.
                  There&#8217;s almost always something beautiful waiting to be
                  photographed&#8230; It never fails that the few times I have
                  left it at home, I end up kicking myself for it later. 🙂

                  Wonderful renderings of your gorgeous dot on the planet Harsi.
                  I adore the newts as you already know. As for the bird, the
                  only one I can think of that color is a flicker. Lovin the
                  gray of today xo

                  *DING DING DING* Right you are, lovely lady, it is indeed a
                  flicker! In addition to winning the admiration of
                  birdwatchers&#8217; everywhere, I promise (later tonight) to
                  finally send you a few of the beautiful photos I took at your
                  house last weekend. 🙂 I am loving the gray weather too, but
                  apparently the newts are not so happy about it. When Ez and I
                  went for a walk a few days ago, we had to really look hard to
                  come up with a mere half-dozen. I&#8217;m guessing once the
                  sun is shining again they&#8217;ll be back to swimming around,
                  mating, and being their newt-y selves.

                  so happy to hear that your vacation went well Harsi- and I
                  love each one of your photos, most especially that very cool
                  newt! We had a small migration of salamanders one evening but
                  within two days snow covered the ground. Spring has been so
                  very slow in arriving here, and my shutter finger is getting
                  more than a bit twitchy 😉

                  Hello Cindy!! &#8220;Salamanders then Snow&#8221;&#8230;
                  Doesn&#8217;t that sound like a great title for a book? 🙂
                  I&#8217;m always fascinated by your tales of wildlife,
                  especially in the winter and early spring months when your
                  weather is so vastly different from mine. I&#8217;m sure
                  you&#8217;ll be out there clicking away soon enough, but until
                  then, it&#8217;s a good thing that you are able to create
                  wonderful &#8220;new images&#8221; using your Photoshop skills
                  and impressive collection of archived shots. Take care!
                </p>
