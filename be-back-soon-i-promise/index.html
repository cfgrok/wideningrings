<p>Â </p>
<p>I had this notion that I would try and stick with doing a full year&#8217;s worth of blogging every day. Why a year? I don&#8217;t know. Just because it sounded good, I guess. It felt like a nice solid accomplishment to shoot for. </p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s only been a little more than three months of continuous blog posts, but I&#8217;m gonna&#8217; need to take a bit of a break. I&#8217;m hoping to only be gone about a week or so as I really do enjoy sharing photos and stories of the things I love most with all of you. My GI problems don&#8217;t seem to be resolving all that quickly and I really want to try and focus as much of my energy as possible on feeling better and getting back outside where I belong. I&#8217;m doing OK and other than being somewhat uncomfortable and very exhausted, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything to worry about.<br><em><br>(Though I chose a photo of a California Ground Squirrel for this post, I can&#8217;t resist mentioning that the fox family continues to come around regularly â€” several times a day now for the past 6 days! Watching them from the window or out the front door has been such a incredible and unimagined delight! In between foraging for dried olives on the ground they will occasionally romp and play, leaving me completely smitten. There are at least 4, and possibly 5 of them. We have seen more foxes in the last week than we have in the last 7 years of living here. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s entirely coincidental, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that the &#8220;nature gods&#8221; decided to smile on me just when I needed it most. Despite how crummy I feel, I can&#8217;t possibly say I wish this last week hadn&#8217;t happened or I&#8217;d have to give up all those wonderful memories in the bargain.) </em></p>

			<p>I feel I&#8217;ve said it so many times before that my words are no longer adequate, but &#8220;thank you&#8221; Chris, for your encouragement and kindness. I had thought that I might feel really disappointed in myself for breaking my running streak&#8230; but I&#8217;m not. I know it&#8217;s OK to take a break sometimes and I certainly have no doubts that you and my other wonderful, loyal readers will still be here when I return. Mostly, I&#8217;m just feeling a bit sad about not getting to share in this space every day, but I know that (at least for right now) my energy is needed elsewhere. Ahhh, but what the hell&#8230; Now that I&#8217;m here, I guess I can&#8217;t resist sharing a few things! *GRIN* The foxes continue to appear, though for briefer visits and not as many of them. Sadly, our unique time with them may be coming to a close. For those who aren&#8217;t a fan of summer and can&#8217;t wait for fall to arrive, I&#8217;ve observed a few wonderful tell-tale signs of the seasonal shift beginning. A tarantula out exploring at dusk &#8212; an increasingly frequent occurrence in the coming months. (Almost certainly a male searching for a female to mate with.) Also, the Northern Flickers have begun making their loud, repetitive and punctuated &#8220;keow!&#8221; calls again. (Most sources describe this call as &#8220;kyeer&#8221;, but it never sounds like that to me.) I believe our local population of these birds is year-round, but for some reason in the middle of summer they become very difficult to observe and nearly silent. Lately, I&#8217;m hearing them every morning though. OK, I gotta&#8217; go now&#8230; you&#8217;re a bad influence, Chris. HA HA. I&#8217;m just kidding. You (and all my friends who visit here) are the best kind of influence and inspiration for me.</p>

			<p>Hey, Harsi of the hills&#8230; just want to join Chris in acknowledging your streak of over *100* daily (consecutive) blogs! Whoooo-hoooo ðŸ™‚ And I love that you can&#8217;t resist sharing some of your latest observances outside. It&#8217;s all so interesting &#8212; especially to me here on the east coast! As Chris said above too, we will all be here whenever you chose to blog again?.</p>

			<p>Whoops! I totally forgot to post your comment, Lisa. Just goes to show how spacey and out-of-it I&#8217;ve been lately. *grin* Oh, well. Thank you, thank you for cheering me on. The more I think about it, the more impressed I am that I actually managed such a long streak. And I&#8217;ll do it again too! I truly do believe that I&#8217;ll be back to blogging every day sometime soon. I think at this point though, the vacation may be longer than I anticipated. We&#8217;ll see&#8230; I still get the urge to post all the time, but find I am just feeling to exhausted and overwhelmed at the moment. Here&#8217;s another mini-update though&#8230; The incredibly intense heat here has been enticing a lot of the mammals towards the houses where it is shadier and there are ample water sources. As I suspected, the regular fox sightings have ceased, but I did just see one last night in front of the house and very early this morning we saw a very exciting interaction between a pair of coyote and some of the deer. The deer were rather aggressively chasing off the coyote, presumably in response to their increased maternal care of the half-grown fawns. A little while later, I spotted a very, very hot looking bobcat rounding the side of the house. So, in addition to all the squirrels and rabbits, there have been a lot of critters running around and giving me plenty to feel grateful for. I miss you all and sincerely hope that everyone is doing well and finding plenty of joy and wonder in their lives.</p>

			<p>cute overload! just swinging by quick-like to see how you&#8217;ve been feeling. I&#8217;ll send an email soon, Garry busted up his hand and broke some fingers and bones today with a splitting maul. My turn to be the caretaker. Hope you&#8217;re on the mend, sending good wishes and vibes from the north! xox\</p>

			<p>Hiya, Cindy! Thank you for stopping by to check in on me&#8230; very sweet of you. I can&#8217;t even remember how long ago it was that I said I would write you back after your last e-mail, but I&#8217;m hoping that we&#8217;ve known each other long enough now that you know my long silence is in no way a reflection of my affection for you. Some things have definitely improved for me, but other things remain stubbornly difficult. I know you will understand and appreciate it when I say that at least my head is staying in a pretty good place. When you don&#8217;t comprehend what your body is doing or what went wrong, it can be so easy to let everything else shut down as well&#8230; your heart, your mind, your spirit. I&#8217;ve not been letting that happen this time and that is a HUGE step in the right direction! I had to look-up what exactly a &#8220;splitting maul&#8221; was&#8230; Oh my! OUCH!! I feel so badly for Garry! I hope you and he have come up with a good way to manage his pain while he heals. I have no doubts about your ability to provide him with the loving care he needs. Despite the many hurdles you face, you always find a way to come through for those you love. I&#8217;m eagerly accepting all those good wishes and vibes your sending &#8212; thank you. xo P.S. Just in case I don&#8217;t manage to write you a &#8220;real&#8221; e-mail soon, I&#8217;ve been wanting to say a few things about stuff on your blog&#8230; Re: &#8220;Starry-eyed&#8221; &#8211; That mantidfly is spectacular!! Perhaps it was not your intent, but imagine if I could look closely enough into its amazing eye, it might look exactly like that beautiful woodland flower. Re: &#8220;What a Wonder Full World&#8221; &#8211; Who could help but fall in love with that little green tree frog? I adore all your photos of frogs and newts&#8230; but &#8212; WOWZA!! &#8212; that is one seriously impressive treehopper! May the wonder of this world never fail to delight either one of us, C!</p>
