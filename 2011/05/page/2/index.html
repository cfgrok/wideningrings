					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/skunk/">Skunk!!!</a></h3>					
											<p>Sadly, I&#8217;m still feeling sick&#8230; but, it was definitely necessary for me to get outside for a little while today. My husband (who&#8217;s also been a bit sick) was kind enough to join me on a mellow walk down to the creek and back. We checked up on the newts&#8230; listened to the birds calling&#8230; I occasionally stopped from time to time to peer at some small beetle or spider. Then, I saw a flash of movement in the creek bed, several feet below the height of the road we were walking on. A somewhat alarmed looking skunk hurried up the embankment on the opposite side of the creek and crashed into the dense foliage. We watched it until it went out of view and then I babbled on about what a wonderful sighting we&#8217;d just had. You see, though we&#8217;ve lived here in the canyon for seven years and have had a few skunk sightings here and there, mostly we are aware of their regular presence solely by the lingering odor that often wafts through the air. The few times that we have seen them, it&#8217;s always been while driving on the road (usually at night) and then we only a get a few seconds to observe them before they slink off out of sight. This was by far the best opportunity we&#8217;d had to really watch one of these lovely creatures! We were about to move on, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw <em>another one</em> emerge from the foliage a little distance behind where the last one had disappeared. Perhaps because we had not startled this one, it was more nonchalant and we quietly watched it forage and dig around for a much longer time before it too finally disappeared from view. It was near sundown and far too dark and shady by the creek for there to be much hope of good photographs, but I did take several video clips and I thought I&#8217;d share a few still images from that footage, just so that you all can share in the experience&#8230; even if it&#8217;s just a bit of blurry black &amp; white. (*grin*)</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: InaiMathi;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong></strong></span></span></span>Lately, I have been feeling the strong urge to CREATE&#8230; poetry, art, music, textiles&#8230; something! </p>
<p>But, again, the <a href="/the-change-thats-coming" target="_blank">perfectionist tendencies</a> that I have always struggled with loom large over the path I&#8217;d like to walk. I have to keep reminding myself that how good something is doesn&#8217;t really matter. (What does &#8220;good&#8221; mean anyway?) It is the daily process of <em>creating</em> that I am craving&#8230; not fame, fortune or approval. (OK&#8230; if I&#8217;m being totally honest, I probably am still craving approval a little&#8230; but, I&#8217;m trying to get past that one.) </p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve been attempting to move <em>forward</em> by going <em>backward</em>. I&#8217;ve been looking at all the things I created as a child. Hoping to rediscover that freedom of expression that seems to elude me these days. I know there was a certain self-confidence I possessed then&#8230; an assuredness that whatever streamed forth from my mind and from my hand was as it was meant to be.</p>
<p>I hope to not only start creating again in earnest, but to share much of it here. For now, I&#8217;ve posted this painting which was done many, many years ago. (I&#8217;m not sure how old I was, but I suspect that I was younger than 13.) I love the flowing lines and open space. The primary colors. The organic sky and oddly geometric bird. Mostly I love the place it came from&#8230; a place I&#8217;m hoping to reconnect with. </p>

											<p>As I was stuck in bed again today, I decided to indulge in one of my favorite pastimes where I go back through my photo archives and check out what was happening on that day&#8217;s date in years gone by. One of the reasons that it is such a bummer to be sick right now is because this is a truly excellent time of year to be observing wildlife — especially in the world of spiders and insects. Apparently, May 19, 2009 was an especially good day for this, and I thought I would share just a small fraction of the arthropods I photographed. </p>

<p>I know this post was a little on the &#8220;nerdy-insect-lover&#8221; side of things, but I truly hope to interest more people in learning about their local bugs, or at least to take a few moments here to enjoy the beauty and diversity of this amazing subset of life.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t stop thinking about my walk yesterday. It was the kind of day that makes you want to write about it with such perfection that everyone reading will instantly know just how you felt. I rarely posses that sort of talent&#8230; but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Oliver" target="_blank"><strong>Mary Oliver</strong></a> does. She is a true master. Her poetry never fails to speak what my heart is saying.</p>

<div class="center"><em><strong>It was spring<br>and finally I heard him<br>among the first leaves &#8211;<br>then I saw him clutching the limb</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>in an island of shade<br>with his red-brown feathers<br>all trim and neat for the new year.<br>First, I stood still</strong></em></div>

<div class="center"><em><strong>when I seemed to float,<br>to be, myself, a wing or a tree &#8211;<br>and I began to understand<br>what the bird was saying,</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>and the sands in the glass<br>stopped<br>for a pure white moment<br>while gravity sprinkled upward</strong><br></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>like rain, rising,<br>and in fact<br>it became difficult to tell just what it was that was singing &#8211;<br>it was the thrush for sure, but it seemed</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>not a single thrush, but himself, and all his brothers,<br>and also the trees around them,<br>as well as the gliding, long-tailed clouds<br>in the perfectly blue sky &#8211; all, all of them</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>were singing.<br>And, of course, yes, so it seemed,<br>so was I.<br>Such soft and solemn and perfect music doesn&#8217;t last</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>for more than a few moments.<br>It&#8217;s one of those magical places wise people<br>like to talk about.<br>One of the things they say about it, that is true,</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>is that, once you&#8217;ve been there,<br>you&#8217;re there forever.<br>Listen, everyone has a chance.<br>Is it spring, is it morning?</strong></em></div>

											<p>OK&#8230; so I&#8217;m really skating the edge of my &#8220;one-a-day post&#8221; promise with this one&#8230; but, technically it <strong><em>is</em></strong> still Monday&#8230; for at least 30 more minutes! *smirk* I confess that I had big plans for all the stuff I was going to get done today, including a fantastic blog post. But, it was so incredibly gorgeous outside this morning that I couldn&#8217;t resist slipping on my shoes and heading up into the hills. I always tend to lose track of time when I&#8217;m outside and if I&#8217;m really in the zone, hours and hours can fly by before I realize how late it&#8217;s gotten. <strong>Some days I go out and take a walk&#8230; other days I go out and <em>the walk takes me</em>!</strong> Anyway, here&#8217;s just a few of the friends I spent time with today:</p>

So, it was a real treat to get to watch this bumble bee methodically visiting one California Poppy (<em>Eschscholzia</em> sp.) after another along the side of the trail I was walking. I should probably double-check myself with my friends on <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/6/bgimage" target="_blank">BugGuide</a>, but I believe this is a <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/155753" target="_blank">California Bumble Bee <em>(Bombus californicus)</em></a>.</span></p>

<p>Sorry for the late post&#8230; it&#8217;s been a busy weekend! I spent the first part of today in my mother-in-law&#8217;s impressively lush garden. We had a bit of rain, then some sun and the most amazing puffy white clouds that filled the sky in a way that couldn&#8217;t help but make a person smile. (I found a bevy of interesting things in her yard and hope to be sharing a few of those discoveries soon!) </p>

<p><strong>Did anything make you grin from ear-to-ear this weekend?</strong></p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">The Good, The Bad &#038; The Ugly</a></h3>					
											<p><a data-fslightbox="blog_lg-20110514-6370" title="moonrise over hillside" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6370.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6370.jpg" alt="moonrise over hillside" width="680" height="340"></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, in the late afternoon, I headed out the door for a walk. I was feeling good and one of the first sights I saw was the faint outline of the moon rising above the hills, which are currently decked out with the pale orange blooms of monkey flower (<em>Diplacus aurantiacus</em>, I think). Usually, by the time I notice the moon in the daytime, it is already fairly high in the sky&#8230; it was cool to capture a few shots of it nearer to the horizon. </p>
<p>I decided to take the road that parallels the seasonal creek. The oaks that grow down there are so magical. And the way it looks when the sunlight streams through the dense canopy is something that my camera never seems quite able to capture. It looked something like this&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a data-fslightbox="blog_lg-20110514-6383" title="oak woodland light" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6383.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6383.jpg" alt="oak woodland light" width="429" height="600"></a></p>
<p>As I was walking, I heard a noise coming from the dense plant growth next to the creek. I looked down and saw this tiny bundle of brown feathers struggling to keep its balance and grip on the twig where it perched. It failed and tumbled down, disappearing into the foliage. I assumed it might be a juvenile bird and so I waited very quietly and patiently to see if it would return. I was delighted when this <em>very young</em> <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/song_sparrow/id" target="_blank">Song Sparrow</a> <em>(Melospiza melodia)</em> reemerged!!</p>
<p><a data-fslightbox="blog_lg-20110514-6415" title="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6415.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6415.jpg" alt="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>The photos aren&#8217;t fantastic due to the heavy shade cover, but as you can see it is in the early stages of feather growth — the wings are nowhere close to their eventual full length and the tail is practically nonexistent! Sweet little thing that it was, it sat there and made the most endearing peeping noises over and over (and over!) again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a data-fslightbox="blog_lg-20110514-6408" title="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6408.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6408.jpg" alt="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>Even though the juvenile didn&#8217;t seem to mind my company, I didn&#8217;t stay too long because I assumed that my presence was probably keeping the parent(s) from returning with food. [Sure enough, when I was walking by the same spot again on my way home, I saw one of the parents flying away from the clump of vegetation where the juvenile was still &#8220;peeping&#8221; away.]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a data-fslightbox="blog_lg-20110514-6501_6483" title="balloon trash" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6501_6483.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6501_6483.jpg" alt="balloon trash" width="680" height="420"></a><span class="caption">Today&#8217;s trash has been brought to you by the letters &#8220;G-R-E-E-N  L-A-N-T-E-R-N&#8221; and the numbers &#8220;6-17-11&#8221;. <br>The title and release date of an upcoming superhero film.</span></p>
<p>So, in this case, &#8220;the bad &amp; the ugly&#8221; part of my walk were the same thing: TRASH. We live in a pretty remote area of the canyon and there is relatively little human and vehicle traffic. Nevertheless, every time I go out for a walk, I bring a bag with me and never fail to find new bits of refuse which I pick-up and take home. The constant winds in the canyon must blow a lot of stuff our way, some things get washed down the creek when we have heavy rains, and some of it undoubtedly gets thrown or falls out of cars traveling on the main road. I try not to get up on my soap box too often, but this issue makes me so disgusted. Balloons seem to push my buttons even more than other things&#8230; I think because they are just so superfluous. The epitome of a single-use, non-essential, impulse item that people don&#8217;t seem to think twice about. They are insidiously designed to escape and travel long distances, often ending up in the mountains or the oceans. Had I not picked it up, the <em>best case</em> scenario for this balloon would be that it continued to break down into smaller and smaller bits of plastic that scatter through the environment. The <em>worst case</em> scenario is that one of the many critters here in the canyon would mistake it for food and try to eat it — a situation which can have dire consequences for the animal. </p>
<p>For those of you who take regular walks in natural areas, I&#8217;d like to ask you to consider carrying a small bag in your pocket or with your gear so that if you run across these bits of garbage you can remove them. I know it&#8217;s only a very small solution to an overwhelming problem, but I truly believe that every little bit helps.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for putting up with my rant. May your Saturday be full of the &#8220;good&#8221; and none of the &#8220;bad &amp; ugly&#8221;!</strong></p>

											<p>Have you ever thought of the words &#8220;fly&#8221; and &#8220;beautiful&#8221; in the same sentence? No?!</p>
<p>Well, let me introduce you to <em>Allograpta obliqua</em>&#8230;</p>
<p><a data-fslightbox="blog_lg-20110513-5897" title="allograpta obliqua on pyracantha" href="/assets/content/20110513/blog_lg-20110513-5897.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110513/blog-20110513-5897.jpg" alt="allograpta obliqua on pyracantha" width="500" height="500"></a><span class="caption">Nectaring on Pyracantha <em>(Pyracantha angustifolia)</em> flowers.</span><br><a data-fslightbox="blog_lg-20110513-7839" title="allograpta obliqua on brassica" href="/assets/content/20110513/blog_lg-20110513-7839.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110513/blog-20110513-7839.jpg" alt="allograpta obliqua on brassica" width="500" height="500"></a><span class="caption">Nectaring on Mustard <em>(Brassica</em> sp.<em>)</em> flowers.</span><br><em>Allograpta obliqua</em> can be found throughout much of North America and is a member of the family Syrphidae, collectively known as Flower Flies or Hover Flies. These names are very fitting as this fly visits a wide variety of flowers to collect nectar and is also an expert flyer with the ability to hover in one place, move sideways or backwards in flight. In addition to the fact that it is a joy to watch and is completely harmless to humans, this is a great fly to have around one&#8217;s garden. By visiting flowers it assists in pollination and it also lays its eggs on plants with aphid colonies, which are decimated by the fly&#8217;s predacious developing larvae.</p>
