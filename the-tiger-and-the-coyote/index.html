                One of the definite highlights of my trip to El Dorado Regional
                Park a couple weeks ago was a beautiful
                <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/24573" target="_blank"

                which repeatedly landed on a close-by patch of

                (commonly referred to as Coyote Mint) and then stayed there like
                someone was paying it to do so. For me and my fellow arthropod
                enthusiast (Chris), this was like hitting the jackpot.

                These butterflies are impressively large, but in my experience,
                they have a frustrating habit of flying around in large circles,
                then landing just long enough for you to lock in your camera
                settings and get them framed nicely. Then, you go to press the
                shutter and find that there&#8217;s no butterfly in the
                viewfinder anymore.<em> Where did it go?! </em>you mutter to
                yourself&#8230; You look around, spy it landing on another
                flower a little ways off, and the process starts all over again.
              </p>
              <p>
                But&#8230; not this particular butterfly. It seemed quite
                smitten with this one small grouping of flowers and though it
                often flitted away for a few seconds, it reliably came back to
                the same spot over and over again, giving us both ample
                opportunity to get many photos in a row and even play around a
                bit with our viewing angle and composition. It was heavenly!!!

                As is so often the case when I sit down to closely examine my
                nature images, I discover things that would be very difficult
                (or impossible) to discern in the field. As I began preparing
                the photos for this post, I was definitely working under the
                presumption that I had only photographed a single butterfly.
                Somehow, the repeated act of it returning to the exact same
                group of flowers just made me
                <em>(and I&#8217;m guessing Chris too)</em> presume that it was
                the same swallowtail each time. Apparently&#8230; not so!! If
                you look closely at the images, you can see that there are
                several notches on the edge of the upper wing of the first
                butterfly (probably caused by a close call with a hungry bird?)
                that are not found on the butterfly in the remaining images.
                Also, if you check out the side-by-side comparison shot I put
                together below, you can see the subtle differences in the
                markings themselves.

                  Hi Harsi, I had one in my garden last week that allowed me to
                  snap off a round of shots. Later when I looked at them I
                  realized one of the bottom wings was missing so her flutter
                  was much more fluttery than usual, still she seemed very
                  vulnerable to a hungry bird. One day while sitting out in my
                  garden I was watching a swallowtail make her way around an I
                  said to Eric, &#8220;oh look at the phoebe&#8221;, not a
                  moment later the phoebe swooped in and all we saw were 4 wings
                  trickling down to the ground. Now you don&#8217;t see that
                  much in a Disney movie, not that Bambi wasn&#8217;t cruel. xo

                  Hiya, Ro! You said it&#8230; I&#8217;ve seen some butterflies
                  that were so tattered it seemed a marvel that they were able
                  to fly at all. I loved the story of you and Eric with the
                  ravenous phoebe!!! I&#8217;ve seen them nab a few smaller
                  butterflies, but never anything as impressively large as a
                  swallowtail&#8230; I bet it won&#8217;t surprise you one bit
                  to hear that I had a really hard time with Bambi when I was
                  young&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t understand what had happened to
                  her mom. They don&#8217;t show you in the movie (right?!) and
                  I guess I couldn&#8217;t conceive of the whole hunting
                  concept. Thought of you several times this morning &#8212; I
                  finally got my 2 to 3 hour walk in the foggy loveliness
                  we&#8217;ve been having! It was superb!

                  Wow! I had indeed thought we were shooting one swallowtail,
                  even after going through my photos. How interesting to see
                  that we were actually shooting two of them! Good catch. There
                  must be something they really like about these flowers because
                  I just never see them sit still, so to have two of them pose
                  for us in so short a time span that we thought it was one
                  butterfly is pretty amazing to me.

                  Hi Chris! I haven&#8217;t seen any of the other photos you
                  took&#8230; But of the two posted on your blog, the first one
                  looks like a match for the first butterfly pictured on my
                  blog. The second one you pictured looks to be the same as the
                  remaining butterfly pics on my blog (note the large chunk
                  missing from the inner portion at the base of the right
                  forewing). So glad we were able to share this (and other)
