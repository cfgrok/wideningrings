              <p>
                Yesterday, I was heading back to bed to relax and read for
                awhile with a hot cup of tea&#8230; but, in doing so I cast a
                passing glance out the east-facing window of my bedroom and
                instantly knew that I wouldn&#8217;t be getting to that herbal
                tea anytime soon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Let me back up for a minute and say a few things&#8230; Ever
                since we moved here to the canyon, I haven&#8217;t been terribly
                inclined to visit other places. Previously, we had lived in a
                truly soul-sucking environment — the suburban apartment complex.
                Perhaps that is a happy housing experience for some, but not for
                us. Every weekend that we could, we made a mad dash for
                someplace more wild and lovely, and in doing so we were often
                heading down to the coast or up into the mountains. But, once we
                moved to this surreal haven, where &#8220;wildlife&#8221; and
                &#8220;homelife&#8221; intersect seamlessly every day, a lot of
                the motivation for getting in a vehicle and sitting on the
                freeway to get somewhere else kind of vanished. Now, some people
                might think that things would get boring wandering around the
                same piece of land day in and day out&#8230; but it never does
                for me. I love being able to get to know this area so
                intimately. Having a feel for when certain bird species will
                return, where certain wildflowers will poke up through the
                ground in Spring, understanding the cyclical quality of how the
                light changes as it filters through the canyon each day in
                winter vs. summer&#8230; these are things that you can only
                grasp after years of living in a place and wandering the same
                trails day after day. While I certainly still feel the thrill of
                excitement that comes from traveling and investigating new
                places, I believe there are always new discoveries to be made
                wherever you are if you are willing to look hard and long
                enough. It is only rarely that I go outside in the canyon and
                don&#8217;t come away with some brand new bit of information
                that I never knew before.
                <em
                  >For instance&#8230; Woodpeckers and thrushes seem to swallow
                  the fruit from the olive trees whole — pit and all! — while
                  finches and sparrows peck at them and swallow little pieces.
                  Or&#8230; Cottontail scat is very different looking in Spring
                  vs. Fall — small, dark and moist vs. larger, light-colored and
                  dry. </em
                >Anyway&#8230; Why am I going on at length about all of this?
                Well, because if I wasn&#8217;t so attuned to my surroundings
                and I didn&#8217;t know the view out my window like the back of
                my hand, I&#8217;m certain the following sighting never would
                have occurred.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, where was I? Oh, yes&#8230; Cup of tea in hand, I stopped
                dead in my tracks, scrutinizing a spot of bare ground under a
                patch of olive trees about 50 feet away. The ground rippled ever
                so slightly. A sinuous shimmer of banded earth. I instantly
                turned on my heel, grabbed my camera and hurried to put on a
                pair of shoes. I walked quickly (but carefully) to the spot
                behind the cabin and scanned the area until I saw it — a large
                rattlesnake slowly making its way across the mostly brown earth.
                My first thought was that this was a really good-sized snake.
                [According to
                <a
                  href="http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/c.o.helleri.html"
                  target="_blank"
                  >CaliforniaHerps.com</a
                >, the average adult length for the subspecies of rattlesnake
                that occurs in this area — the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake
                <em>(Crotalus oreganus helleri)</em> — is &#8220;30 – 44 inches
                long, sometimes up to 54 inches&#8221;. After doing a little
                post-sighting calculation, using the photographs that I took as
                a guide, I went back out and measured some of the adjacent
                rocks. Not an exact science, to be sure, but using that data I
                arrived at an approximate measurement for the snake of
                <strong>47 to 50 inches</strong>!!] It certainly made for an
                impressive sight and (despite my affection for these snakes) a
                bit intimidating too. A curled-up snake, if given its space is
                never something that concerns me too much, but with an active
                snake I think it&#8217;s really important to keep an eye on them
                and make sure to leave ample distance between yourself and the
                snake — especially when a portion of your attention (and visual
                field!) is compromised by photographing or filming. I stayed
                several feet behind the snake and moved slowly so as not to
                alarm or intimidate it. My presence seemed to go completely
                ignored, which is exactly what I aim for when shooting in the
                field. After several moments out in the open, during which time
                it investigated small clumps of plants and bits of wood,
                occasionally flicking its tongue to &#8220;taste&#8221; the air,
                it finally disappeared into denser foliage. I am definitely NOT
                foolish enough to follow a rattler into an area where I
                can&#8217;t keep track of it, so I said a sincere &#8220;thank
                you&#8221; (as I always do with accommodating wildlife) and
                headed back inside. I was pretty sure my tea would need to be
                re-heated, but what a very small price to pay for such a lasting
                memory.

                  Woah!! Amazing story! That is a huge snake. We don&#8217;t see
                  things like that out here in NY. Lucky you happened to look
                  out the window at that very moment. Nice when things work out
                  like that. What a wonderful place to be living. I like the
                  description of the changing light. Once you get to know the
                  cycles of light throughout the year, you know you have
                  established a strong bond with a place. I have gotten to know
                  the lighting around our lake pretty well over the past 4
                  years. It&#8217;s a wonderful thing. Oh, and it also helps
                  with photography&#8230; 🙂 Great story &#038; stay safe around
                  all that wildlife!! B

                  Hey, B! Yeah&#8230; even Ezra (who is usually very low-affect
                  about such things) was impressed by the size of this one. 🙂
                  Your comment made me imagine wonderful scenarios involving
                  your lake and the light there. Water adds a whole other
                  dimension to light &#8212; one that I don&#8217;t get here in
                  the dry canyon. I really enjoyed all the pond, lake, ocean
                  shots that I got to take up in Washington and I can totally
                  see myself having a field day (photographically-speaking) with
                  that new environment. Someday, I would love to be able to see
                  your place through my camera lens. What a wonderful new
                  experience that would be!!
