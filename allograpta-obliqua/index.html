                ><br /><em>Allograpta obliqua</em> can be found throughout much
                of North America and is a member of the family Syrphidae,
                collectively known as Flower Flies or Hover Flies. These names
                are very fitting as this fly visits a wide variety of flowers to
                collect nectar and is also an expert flyer with the ability to
                hover in one place, move sideways or backwards in flight. In
                addition to the fact that it is a joy to watch and is completely
                harmless to humans, this is a great fly to have around
                one&#8217;s garden. By visiting flowers it assists in
                pollination and it also lays its eggs on plants with aphid
                colonies, which are decimated by the fly&#8217;s predacious
                developing larvae.

                  Hi Harsi &#8211; I just learned more about these Hover Flies
                  (as they are most commonly known here) by googling them :).
                  It&#8217;s interesting that they have a single functional pair
                  of wings since the hindwings are reduced to balancing organs.
                  Thanks for sharing this today &#8212; the photos are
                  wonderful. I like your &#8220;tip&#8221; too on telling the
                  males and females apart. xoxo ~Lisa

                  Hey Harsi! Great photos of this one. Very fitting, too; I ran
                  into this very syrphid earlier today while exploring the Bolsa
                  chica wetlands (ran into atleast one other syrphid today as
                  well, a Paragus sp. I believe). I don&#8217;t pay too much
                  attention to flies in general, but it&#8217;s hard to overlook
                  the syrphids (and bee flies too for that matter!) &#8211;
                  perhaps, as you mentioned, among the most beautiful of the
                  flies. ps: Is that your camera lens reflecting in the
                  fly&#8217;s thorax in the second and third picture? 😉

                  ~Lisa~ I&#8217;m so very glad that this post inspired you to
                  learn about this family of flies!! (That is the best possible
                  thing I could hope for from publishing this blog &#8212; that
                  it prompts people to be curious and interested in the wildlife
                  featured.) Keep reading &#8212; there will be plenty more
                  fascinating insects to come!! xo ~Chris~ So cool that you were
                  down at Bolsa Chica today&#8230; it&#8217;s been quite some
                  time since I&#8217;ve gotten down there myself. We used to
                  mostly go in order to birdwatch, so I&#8217;ve never gone
                  hunting for insects there before. (See any other nifty
                  critters besides syrphids?) If bet there are some really
                  interesting plants in that specialized habitat&#8230; all I
                  can remember is Pickleweed, but there must be many others?

                  Gosh what a beauty! I have never noticed these guys before, I
                  must look closer, your photo&#8217;s are astonishing. You can
                  bet I&#8217;ll be checking out the garden today. Thanks for
                  the heads up. I agree with Lisa Bird, now I&#8217;ll know if
                  i&#8221;m looking at a boy or girl. Have a wonderful weekend,

                  Ro, I have absolutely no doubt that your incredibly lush and
                  lovely garden attracts droves of these flies! They are small
                  and do take a bit of patience in approaching them &#8212; but,
                  it&#8217;s soooo worth it. (Actually, cloudy cooler days like
                  today are a great time to look because they aren&#8217;t quite
                  as speedy.) With a lot of insects it is difficult (or near
                  impossible) to tell what gender they are, but in the ones
                  where it&#8217;s obvious like this, I always enjoy making the
                  distinction. Then&#8230; after our photo session, I can say
                  things like &#8220;Thank you so much, kind sir&#8221; or
                  &#8220;Have a good day, lovely lady&#8221;. 🙂 🙂 🙂

                  Harsi &#8211; I went there mainly to check out the
                  plantlife&#8230; many interesting species indeed, many new to
                  me so I can&#8217;t give you any specific names yet (Calflora
                  wasn&#8217;t working all yesterday). Arthropods came as an
                  added bonus&#8230; if I can remember everything correctly,
                  some of the other arthropods I saw were Argiope argentata (a
                  really beautiful spider mostly on Prickley pear), Squash bugs
                  (mostly on wishbone bush), an interesting thread-waisted wasp
                  (Ammophila), as well as the usual suspects such as
                  ground-wandering tenebs and flower-loving dasytinae. But
                  I&#8217;ve heard that it is a good birding spot, I need to
                  return there sometime to search for some birds 🙂

                <p>
                  Sounds like you had an enjoyable and productive visit!
                  I&#8217;ll keep an eye on your website and BugGuide to track
                  the progress of your plant &#038; arthropod IDs. A. argentata
                  is INDEED a beautiful spider&#8230; I think I might have seen
                  one once a loooong time ago, but it was before my insect
                  interest had taken hold, so I didn&#8217;t pay very close
                  attention. 🙁 There&#8217;s still stuff going on in the
                  summertime at Bolsa Chica, but the birding gets really
                  interesting there in Fall &#038; Winter &#8212; prime time for
                  all the ducks, shorebirds, pelicans, terns, etc.
