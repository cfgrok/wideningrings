                      OK, so I know this is an out-of-focus, improperly exposed
                      and poorly composed shot&#8230; but, how could anyone not
                      save and treasure this photo?! As I was
                      <a href="/now-are-the-foxes" target="_blank"
                        >saying yesterday</a
                      >, several foxes have been hanging out around our place
                      lately. The amazing thing about our cabin is that it
                      serves as a really nice blind for viewing wildlife. In
                      general, (with Coyote being a notable exception to the
                      rule) the mammals appear to view the cabin as just another
                      element of their environment and as long as you
                      don&#8217;t make any sudden movements, they seem to ignore
                      slight movements at the windows, or else simply stare with
                      a cautious curiosity. I have seen and photographed (or
                      filmed) some truly astounding things through the windows
                      of this place! There are downsides, of course. All but one
                      or two of the windows in the house are screened and those
                      photos are often very blurred or distorted-looking. The
                      large picture window in the kitchen is my favorite place
                      to photograph, but even those photos only come out well if
                      I can shoot straight ahead. If I have to point the camera
                      at an angle to the glass, the photos are once again
                      distorted. Fortunately, while I do have very high
                      standards for what I consider to be a beautifully-executed
                      nature photograph, I also see plenty of value in those
                      images that serve as visual field notes or simply to
                      capture a happy memory or experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So&#8230; back to the photo! I shot this one as I crouched
                      at the base of my smaller, screened kitchen window.  (The
                      black on the left side of the image is actually the window
                      frame.) The fox was busily gnawing away at one dried-up
                      olive after another just beyond the ledge of the window
                      (maybe 10 feet!) and seemed entirely oblivious to my
                      presence. Though it looks as though it is making eye
                      contact with me here, I&#8217;m pretty sure that it was
                      just eyeballing the house itself. I&#8217;m assuming that
                      the little bit of tongue sticking out is also incidental
                      and not directed at me personally. *GRIN*

                      idea sooner. But, hey, let&#8217;s have a little fun with
                      tadpoles!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I walked down to the creek a few days ago with the intent
                      of exploring a remaining shallow pool of water that my
                      neighbor had pointed out to me. I wanted to confirm my
                      initial suspicions that there were at least three
                      different kinds of amphibian larvae in various stages of
                      development. Sure enough! Additionally, there were several
                      different kinds of aquatic beetles, bugs and snails. There
                      was also a large interesting-looking dragonfly laying eggs
                      on the exposed rocks. I was so excited and ready to get
                      down to some serious photographing, but then&#8230; This
                      rarely happens to me, but (sadly) just as I got to this
                      point, my camera batteries died. *sigh*
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I use rechargeable AAs and I always carry a spare set, but
                      apparently I forgot to charge them after the last outing
                      and these turned out to also be dead. Not sure if anyone
                      else has ever been this desperate, but in order to get the
                      following shots I would turn on the camera and take like
                      one or two shots before it gave up the ghost and turned
                      itself off. Then, I would turn it back on and try and eke
                      out a few more real quick before it shut down again.
                      Frankly, I am surprised these turned out as well as they
                      did!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      OK, so here are the three suspects for those who want to
                      have fun guessing what they will eventually metamorphosize
                      into&#8230;

                      Despite the unusually cool temps for mid-August, the
                      remaining water in the creek is still rapidly evaporating.
                      I hope that the majority of these little ones get a chance
                      to develop enough to survive outside of their puddle
                      refuge.

                      No tricks with this one! Nothing mirrored, flipped,
                      reversed, altered or otherwise manipulated. What you see
                      is simply a cropped poriton of a larger photo. It looked
                      so otherworldly to me today that I wondered how
                      recognizable it would be without the surrounding context.

                    <p>
                      This past week, I took a few more shots of trees with the
                      express intention of playing around with flipping the
                      photos. I had such a good time with the last few (mir)ror
                      im(age) posts —
                      <a href="/mirror-image" target="_blank">here</a> and
                      <a href="/trials-toyon-ations" target="_blank">here</a> —
                      but I wondered how I could step it up a notch for this
                      round.

                      Well, if two images mirroring each other created something
                      fantastical&#8230; <em>What would FOUR look like?</em>

                    <p>
                      I had planned to write something today about my recent
                      wildlife sightings around here. I had several other small
                      projects and &#8220;to do&#8221; items lined up for myself
                      as well. And, I definitely — <em>definitely!</em> — had
                      earmarked a chunk of the day for a walk outside. But, as
                      John Lennon sang,
                      <em
                        >&#8220;Life is what happens to you while you&#8217;re
                        busy making other plans.&#8221;</em
                      >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In my case, &#8220;life&#8221; included: an impressive
                      number of big ants invading the bed + me asleep + a very
                      unseemly hour of the morning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I&#8217;ll spare you the somewhat traumatizing details and
                      just tell you that I didn&#8217;t get any sleep after that
                      and spent much of the day trying to ensure that it
                      doesn&#8217;t happen again tonight. I think I&#8217;ve
                      done as much as I can and I&#8217;m already finding ways
                      to laugh at my early morning ordeal.
                      <em>(What else are you gonna&#8217; do?!) </em>But, as I
                      never did get around to writing the post I had in mind, I
                      hope no one minds seeing another one of the

                      I decided I didn&#8217;t like that as much. But, then I
                      thought&#8230; <em>Maybe you need both!</em> So, I decided
                      to see what they would look like side-by-side&#8230;

                      Actually, what resulted was sort of a happy accident. I
                      had intended on putting the two images together in a
                      manner similar to
                      <a href="/common-ground" target="_blank"
                        >the image I shared here</a
                      >
                      with a thin black border between. I happened to place them
                      too close together and (fortunately!) I saw this marvelous
                      pattern and shape appear. I love when you can do something
                      in a graphics program with your photo that manages to
                      retain its essential nature but also adds a new dimension
                      or element. In this case, it was already so fantastical
                      and surreal that I thought I would go just one step
                      further and turn the image upside down&#8230;

                      Now, I had originally planned at this point to tell you
                      how excited and impressed I was by the figure that
                      appeared to me when I stared at this last image&#8230; But
                      then I thought it might be more fun (à la the
                      <a href="/epic-battle" target="_blank"
                        >interactive-cloud-gazing post</a
                      >) if I asked y&#8217;all: 
                      <strong><em>What do you see?</em></strong>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      [P.S. When I was trying to come up with an interesting
                      name for this approach (technique?) (style?), a few of the
                      words that I was playing around with were &#8220;<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage"
                        target="_blank"
                        >mirage</a
                      >&#8221; and &#8220;<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_image"
                        target="_blank"
                        >mirror image</a
                      >&#8221; as both terms seemed apropos. It dawned on me
                      that the first word was contained within the letters of
                      the second. I thought that was nifty! Though, perhaps
                      there&#8217;s no great surprise in this as apparently the
                      words &#8220;mirror&#8221; and &#8220;mirage&#8221; share
                      the same Latin root — <em>mirare</em>, meaning &#8220;to
                      look at, to wonder at&#8221;.]
