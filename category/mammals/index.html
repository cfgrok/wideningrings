                      on the morning of the 23rd in honor of the autumnal
                      equinox, I wrote:

                      I didn&#8217;t have to wait very long to find out. About
                      an hour later, I encountered this gorgeous immature
                      rattlesnake just hanging out at the base of our porch
                      steps.

                      My last rattler sighting had been back on the 12th of
                      August (which feels like ages ago), so I felt rather
                      satisfied by the sighting and pleased with the pics that I
                      managed to get. It seemed like a truly auspicious
                      beginning to the unfolding new season!

                      Little could I have possibly imagined that the very same
                      morning would also bring <strong>THIS</strong>&#8230;.

                      This is a teaser post as there are other better photos and
                      an entire story that still needs telling. I&#8217;ve been
                      holding my tongue on sharing this news for a couple days
                      now though and I simply couldn&#8217;t wait any longer.

                      <strong>Life is good. </strong>It may not always be easy.
                      You may not always get things exactly <em>how</em> you
                      want them or <em>when</em> you want them. But there are
                      lions and snakes and birds and trees and spiders and moons
                      and toads and rainbows and squirrels and clouds and all
                      the other totally amazing things that make me wonder what
                      tomorrow will bring and keep me hangin&#8217; in there to
                      find out!

                      I had this notion that I would try and stick with doing a
                      full year&#8217;s worth of blogging every day. Why a year?
                      I don&#8217;t know. Just because it sounded good, I guess.
                      It felt like a nice solid accomplishment to shoot for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Well, it&#8217;s only been a little more than three months
                      of continuous blog posts, but I&#8217;m gonna&#8217; need
                      to take a bit of a break. I&#8217;m hoping to only be gone
                      about a week or so as I really do enjoy sharing photos and
                      stories of the things I love most with all of you. My GI
                      problems don&#8217;t seem to be resolving all that quickly
                      and I really want to try and focus as much of my energy as
                      possible on feeling better and getting back outside where
                      I belong. I&#8217;m doing OK and other than being somewhat
                      uncomfortable and very exhausted, I don&#8217;t think
                      there&#8217;s anything to worry about.<br /><em
                        ><br />(Though I chose a photo of a California Ground
                        Squirrel for this post, I can&#8217;t resist mentioning
                        that the fox family continues to come around regularly —
                        several times a day now for the past 6 days! Watching
                        them from the window or out the front door has been such
                        a incredible and unimagined delight! In between foraging
                        for dried olives on the ground they will occasionally
                        romp and play, leaving me completely smitten. There are
                        at least 4, and possibly 5 of them. We have seen more
                        foxes in the last week than we have in the last 7 years
                        of living here. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s entirely
                        coincidental, but I can&#8217;t help but feel that the
                        &#8220;nature gods&#8221; decided to smile on me just
                        when I needed it most. Despite how crummy I feel, I
                        can&#8217;t possibly say I wish this last week
                        hadn&#8217;t happened or I&#8217;d have to give up all
                        those wonderful memories in the bargain.)

                      >, several foxes have been hanging out around our place
                      lately. The amazing thing about our cabin is that it
                      serves as a really nice blind for viewing wildlife. In
                      general, (with Coyote being a notable exception to the
                      rule) the mammals appear to view the cabin as just another
                      element of their environment and as long as you
                      don&#8217;t make any sudden movements, they seem to ignore
                      slight movements at the windows, or else simply stare with
                      a cautious curiosity. I have seen and photographed (or
                      filmed) some truly astounding things through the windows
                      of this place! There are downsides, of course. All but one
                      or two of the windows in the house are screened and those
                      photos are often very blurred or distorted-looking. The
                      large picture window in the kitchen is my favorite place
                      to photograph, but even those photos only come out well if
                      I can shoot straight ahead. If I have to point the camera
                      at an angle to the glass, the photos are once again
                      distorted. Fortunately, while I do have very high
                      standards for what I consider to be a beautifully-executed
                      nature photograph, I also see plenty of value in those
                      images that serve as visual field notes or simply to
                      capture a happy memory or experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      So&#8230; back to the photo! I shot this one as I crouched
                      at the base of my smaller, screened kitchen window.  (The
                      black on the left side of the image is actually the window
                      frame.) The fox was busily gnawing away at one dried-up
                      olive after another just beyond the ledge of the window
                      (maybe 10 feet!) and seemed entirely oblivious to my
                      presence. Though it looks as though it is making eye
                      contact with me here, I&#8217;m pretty sure that it was
                      just eyeballing the house itself. I&#8217;m assuming that
                      the little bit of tongue sticking out is also incidental
                      and not directed at me personally. *GRIN*

                      sightings around our cabin! I saw two running together one
                      day and there is also a third who is recognizable due to a
                      injured front foot. They&#8217;ve been showing up to get a
                      drink of water at the containers, but at least one of them
                      is also coming to chow down on the dried-up olives that
                      litter the ground beyond our front porch. These
                      creatures&#8217; coloration is incredibly beautiful and
                      they are so agile and dainty. It never ceases to amaze me
                      how small they are (usually somewhere between 30 and 40
                      inches long, but their tail accounts for about half of
                      that)!

                      I always feel blessed to have the opportunity to live in
                      such close proximity to these foxes, but I have felt more
                      intensely grateful of late. Being able to look out the
                      window and view something so wonderful is a true gift. You
                      see, I&#8217;ve been stuck inside (and mostly in bed) with
                      some seriously nasty GI thing. I haven&#8217;t really
                      wanted to clutter this blog with talk of that
                      unpleasantness, but if by any chance you&#8217;ve been
                      waiting on return correspondence for me — I&#8217;m very
                      sorry for the silence. Just trying to take it easy and
                      give my body time to heal and feel better.

                      Hopefully, there will be more photos and stories about our
                      foxy neighbors (and also some more adorable deer photos)
                      in the next few days&#8230; *grin*

                      This season&#8217;s fawns are already down to their last
                      few spots. There&#8217;s still a smattering around their
                      hindquarters though, like an outfit they&#8217;ve just
                      about outgrown. Every year it&#8217;s the same, the last
                      hint of their juvenile patterned coat remaining on the
                      back half of the deer. It makes me wonder&#8230; why?

                      around the house, one of the frequent photographic hurdles
                      I encounter in trying to expose the shot is an overly
                      bright background and loss of detail or sharpness in the
                      darker foreground critter. Nevertheless, I am often still
                      quite attached to these photos due to compositional
                      elements or subject matter. As I discussed

                      to try and salvage less-than-perfect images or perhaps let
                      my creativity take me in entirely new and fanciful

                      I was looking through some old folders of images that I
                      hadn&#8217;t browsed recently and came across this series
                      I took back in July of 2006. A

                      raised her young under a little wooden bridge behind our
                      cabin that year and I had the fun of seeing the whole
                      family out together on several occasions. I&#8217;m not
                      sure where the mother was on this day, but her spectacled
                      brood sure was adorable as they cautiously ran in and out
                      of their burrow.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      I sat down today to work on prepping those Mule Deer
                      images I promised. Several young males (last year&#8217;s
                      fawns) have been hanging about lately. Adult females and
                      their spotted little ones share their company as they make
                      daily visits around the perimeter of the cabin. They stop
                      to get a drink of water, nibble on the plants and bushes,
                      and to lay in the cool, shady areas. In photographing
                      them, I managed to capture some wonderful expressions and
                      behavior. However, as is often the case (especially if I
                      attempt to shoot through the kitchen window), I found
                      myself unhappy with the quality of the photos. It&#8217;s
                      not that they&#8217;re horrible, they simply suffer from
                      various problems like soft focus, contrasty lighting,
                      improper exposure or unwanted objects. Using a graphics
                      program like Photoshop, there are countless ways to
                      attempt to improve or fix these issues. Some times I go
                      that route&#8230; But, other times, I find that if an
                      image needs a significant amount of manipulation
                      it&#8217;s just more fun to unleash my creativity instead
                      of trying to make it look like the perfect photograph I
                      had imagined. By playing with the digital filters and
                      brushes, altering the color palette or lighting,
                      it&#8217;s possible to create a myriad of artistic
                      effects.

                    <p>
                      I thought it might be interesting to start by showing you
                      this image exactly as it looked after I downloaded it from
                      my camera:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      <img
                        loading="lazy"
                        decoding="async"
                        class="center"
                        src="/assets/content/20110801/blog-20110801-2245b.jpg"
                        alt="Mule Deer, male eating Toyon"
                        width="680"
                        height="510"
                      />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This young male was so blissfully chewing away on the
                      Toyon leaves, that he hardly seemed to notice me standing
                      at the window taking photos. It was a beautiful few
                      moments. But, the image looked so washed out and lifeless
                      to me. I wanted to try and add more of the warmth and
                      intimacy that I had felt. Also, the background was very
                      bright and eye-catching, so I hoped to even out the light
                      some, make it twinkle a bit, and highlight all the
                      wonderful leaves.

                    <p>
                      I liked the way the deer fills this square crop and the
                      painterly effect is very close to what I had envisioned.
                      (If anyone is interested, I used the &#8220;Accented
                      Edges&#8221; filter and then experimented with the color
                      and exposure.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I know it can be very hard to get a feel for the
                      subtleties of the texture and brush strokes with the small
                      size of web presentation. I usually do provide a larger
                      version that can be seen my clicking on the image, but it
                      is still a very limited view. So, here is a crop showing
                      just a portion of the above image so that you can see more
                      detail.

                      In this next instance, you can see an example of an
                      original image which is really not very good. But, I so
                      loved the composition and the delightful scene it
                      portrayed that I wanted to try and do something nice with
                      it.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                      These two young males decided to lay down near each other
                      in late afternoon shade. They were just within view
                      through my kitchen window and they weren&#8217;t going
                      anywhere, but no matter how many photos I took, the glass
                      distortion and lighting conspired to leave me with less
                      than satisfactory shots. Additionally, there was that
                      exposed (defunct) pipe jutting out off the ground next to
                      the upper deer in every single image. It was the layered
                      appearance of the background and the repeating shapes of
                      the deer that had compelled me to take the photo in the
                      first place, so I tried to focus on those elements when
                      cropping and transforming it. (In this case, the filtering
                      process also makes it very easy to seamlessly clone a
                      portion of the background to obscure the unattractive
                      pipe.)

                      Though I don&#8217;t always succeed, it is always my goal
                      to accomplish something that is <em>better</em> than the
                      original photo. To create something that tugs at the
                      essence of what I saw when I first lifted my camera, but
                      then draws it out further&#8230; Exaggerating it to evoke
                      an emotion or feeling that might otherwise have gone
                      unnoticed.

                    <p>
                      When I opened my eyes this morning, it took me a moment to
                      reconcile the sound. <em></em>
                    </p>
                    <p>Rain?!</p>
                    <p>
                      That didn&#8217;t seem very likely&#8230; I sat up and let
                      the fog of sleep drift further away.

                      Not a lot, mind you&#8230; Just enough to dapple the brown
                      earth and make the air smell moist and alive. But, here in
                      the canyon at the tail-end of July, any rain at all is a
                      rarity and I was grateful for it. I&#8217;m quite certain
                      that the wildlife shared my elation as well.

                      The sky was overcast and lovely for much of the day, but
                      by late afternoon when I finally got clear of the
                      &#8220;to do&#8221; stuff on my list and went out for a
                      walk, the big clouds had mostly retreated and were
                      accumulating over the peaks of the

                      I walked down to the oak woodland area that parallels the
                      road. It was hot and humid and the bitey flies were out in
                      force looking for a meal. (I&#8217;m not sure if we are as
                      tasty as the main course — the local Mule Deer — but that
                      certainly doesn&#8217;t stop them from sampling.)
                      Fortunately, I had good company and was happy to be out
                      despite the constant waving and swatting.

                      Previously, I had mentioned that our seasonal creek has
                      completely dried up in several spots. I thought it might
                      be interesting to illustrate this and so I searched
                      through my photos to see what I could find. The picture on
                      the left was taken in early February of this year. This
                      spot along the creek forms a large, slow-moving, shallow
                      pool that is always a favorite congregating spot for the
                      breeding

                      week, and as you can clearly see, the ground is little
                      more than damp now.

                      Tomorrow&#8217;s post will feature a bunch of pics of the
                      Mule Deer who can (with increasing frequency) be found
                      resting and browsing for food in the relatively cooler,
                      shadier areas around our cabin. In truth, I meant to share
                      them with you today, but (like the female pictured below)
                      I ran out of steam and decided to take it easy instead. I
                      hope everyone else is finding ways to beat the heat and
                      still enjoy some time outside!

                      One of the Photoshop techniques that I enjoy applying to
                      some of my photos involves desaturating the image to
                      remove all of the color and then selectively painting
                      portions where I want to bring it back. It can make an
                      artistic statement, draw the eye to a particularly lovely
                      element, or help to make the primary subject matter stand
                      out from a similarly-colored background. Here are a few
                      that I&#8217;ve been playing with over the last several
                      months&#8230;

                    <p>
                      The title of this blog post reminds me a little of
                      Aesop&#8217;s fables. Though, in this case, the two story
                      lines are not related and you won&#8217;t find a moral at
                      the end.

                      Sitting in my bedroom today, I saw a little movement out
                      of the corner of my eye and looked up in time to see a
                      <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_fox"
                        target="_blank"
                        >Gray Fox <em>(Urocyon cinereoargenteus)</em> trotting
                        down the path just outside my window. It looked very
                        hot. <em>(Weren&#8217;t we all today?!) </em>Being
                        mostly nocturnal, we don&#8217;t commonly see fox in the
                        daytime and I wonder if this one was looking for water.
                        I tried to follow it around to the other side of the
                        cabin, but I lost sight of it. So&#8230; no photos to
                        share with you. But, in celebration of the sighting,
                        here&#8217;s a picture of another fox who made daytime
                        visits to our cabin on several occasions in the Spring
                        of 2010:</a

                      In other news&#8230; Somewhere in the early afternoon, I
                      finished washing a big pile of dishes then sat down to
                      have some lunch and work on a few things. When I got back
                      and wandered into the kitchen I was amazed to see that the
                      entire sink and counter top was crawling with ants.
                      <em
                        >Where did they come from? How did there get to be so
                        many so quickly?!
                      </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I have thought it before and I will say it here now: It is
                      a very good thing indeed that there are not human-sized
                      ants. It&#8217;s not just their incredible strength,
                      ability to wage chemical warfare or formidable jaws and
                      stingers that should be respected. It&#8217;s also their
                      supreme skill when it comes to communicating, organizing
                      and executing tasks. If you&#8217;ve ever spent any time
                      watching ants, you&#8217;ll know what I mean. It is truly
                      astonishing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Back to the ants at hand&#8230; I always do my best to
                      avoid killing unnecessarily. After all, the ants
                      aren&#8217;t trying to make your life more difficult by
                      invading your home — they&#8217;re just doing what ants
                      do. Looking for food, or water or shelter from the
                      elements. Often I find that a good cleaning of the area is
                      enough to slow their numbers and then (if possible) I find
                      the crack(s) or opening(s) that they are using and try to
                      physically block them. For those ants that haven&#8217;t
                      managed to retreat back from whence they came, I let them
                      crawl onto a piece of paper or cardboard and escort them
                      outside.
                      <em
                        >(This is often the point where some people roll their
                        eyes at me.)</em
                      >
                      Don&#8217;t misunderstand me, I do have to kill ants on
                      occasion. Sometimes their numbers overwhelm me, or they
                      refuse to leave even after I&#8217;ve done all the steps I
                      outlined. In those cases, I prefer to simply squish them.
                      I don&#8217;t use any pesticides or harsh chemicals in my
                      home if I don&#8217;t absolutely have to.

                      I was a bit thrown by the situation that presented itself
                      today though because these were not the tiny black ants
                      that I was used to dealing with. These were much larger
                      and their mouthparts looked large enough to be painful if
                      they decided to bite. I decided to just work around them
                      carefully, removing everything from the counter and the
                      sink, cleaning as I went. As they began to retreat, it
                      became clear where they were coming in and I set about
                      blocking the cracks and escorting the stragglers outside.
                      I&#8217;m happy to report that within a couple of hours
                      the situation was mostly resolved! And with only one ant
                      death — an accident on my part.

                    <p>
                      So, what is the moral? Well, I suppose it&#8217;s that
                      sometimes it&#8217;s not necessary to squish and spray the
                      insects that find their way into our homes. Or, perhaps
                      it&#8217;s that despite the inconvenience of having to
                      drop everything and rearrange my afternoon, my kitchen has
                      never looked better! *GRIN*

                      I really was quite impressed with the size of the ants we
                      had today, but only in comparison to the size of the ones
                      we usually get. I&#8217;ve watched enough ants out on the
                      trail to know that they can get much,
                      <em>much</em> larger. Check out this (as of yet)
                      unidentified species:
