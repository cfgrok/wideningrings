<p>This may be the most brightly colored <a href="http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/e.m.webbii.html" target="_blank">Southern Alligator Lizard <em>(Elgaria multicarinata webbii)</em></a> I have ever seen!! They are always beautifully patterned, but usually draped in more subtle shades of brown, gray or green. <em>(Sightings like this are always so much fun, but they are even more fun when my neighbor and her 3 yr. old son are along for the walk. Many thanks, J, for spotting this one for me on our walk together last week!) <br></em><br>The alligator lizards around here seem to really enjoy hanging out at various points along the main road as it parallels the creek. <a href="http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/e.m.webbii.html" target="_blank">CaliforniaHerps.com</a> describes them as &#8220;generally secretive, tending to hide in brush or under rocks, although they are often seen foraging out in the open or on roads in the morning and evening. They are common inhabitants of suburban yards and garages.&#8221; This description matches up quite well with my own observations over the years. I&#8217;ve often found them creeping about on our porch in the early morning hours and twice I&#8217;ve had to figure out how to trap-and-release young ones that somehow found a way inside the house itself. <em>(I can tell you from firsthand experience that the snake-like look of their head and eye can really throw you for a loop if you can&#8217;t see the rest of their body&#8230; Just imagine one popping its head out from behind a bookcase as you are strolling through your living room. *grin*) </em></p>

<p>They can move extremely fast when they want to, but my experience has been that they prefer to remain very still up until the last possible second that danger (or possibly prey?) approaches. When the object finally gets too close, they either strike or run away. Sadly, it is my belief that this strategy — which may work quite well in most situations — might be responsible for the potentially large number of accidental deaths along the road to our home. They seem to rest in the shadier spots and can be extremely difficult to pick-out from the surrounding ground, twigs and leaves. I think that this, combined with their seeming preference to remain motionless until something approaches very closely, may prove to be a fatal combination when sharing their habitat with automobiles. I can only hope that their numbers in this area are healthy enough to support these tragic losses. <em> (For what it&#8217;s worth, I always move the dead bodies off to the side of the road and I am pleased to report that there are enough scavengers here that the corpses rarely linger for more than 24 to 48 hours before something makes a meal of them.) </em></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of people that they think these guys are &#8220;creepy&#8221;. I&#8217;ve also heard some comments that they bite and are aggressive. I can only say that I have never personally experienced any of these things. And, aside from being startled on occasion — <em>they do look and move a lot like a snake! </em>— I greatly enjoy having these lizards around and only wish that I had more opportunities to photograph them. </p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/the-fox-and-the-ant/">The Fox and The Ant</a></h3>					
											<p>The title of this blog post reminds me a little of Aesop&#8217;s fables. Though, in this case, the two story lines are not related and you won&#8217;t find a moral at the end. <em>(Well&#8230; okay, maybe just a little one!)</em></p>
<p>Sitting in my bedroom today, I saw a little movement out of the corner of my eye and looked up in time to see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_fox" target="_blank">Gray Fox <em>(Urocyon cinereoargenteus)</em> trotting down the path just outside my window. It looked very hot. <em>(Weren&#8217;t we all today?!) </em>Being mostly nocturnal, we don&#8217;t commonly see fox in the daytime and I wonder if this one was looking for water. I tried to follow it around to the other side of the cabin, but I lost sight of it. So&#8230; no photos to share with you. But, in celebration of the sighting, here&#8217;s a picture of another fox who made daytime visits to our cabin on several occasions in the Spring of 2010:</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Gray Fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus)" href="/assets/content/20110719/blog_lg-20110719-1839.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110719/blog-20110719-1839.jpg" alt="Gray Fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus)" width="440" height="550"></a><span class="caption"><em>Don&#8217;t you just love the black stripe on their tails?</em></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In other news&#8230; Somewhere in the early afternoon, I finished washing a big pile of dishes then sat down to have some lunch and work on a few things. When I got back and wandered into the kitchen I was amazed to see that the entire sink and counter top was crawling with ants. <em>Where did they come from? How did there get to be so many so quickly?! </em></p>
<p>I have thought it before and I will say it here now: It is a very good thing indeed that there are not human-sized ants. It&#8217;s not just their incredible strength, ability to wage chemical warfare or formidable jaws and stingers that should be respected. It&#8217;s also their supreme skill when it comes to communicating, organizing and executing tasks. If you&#8217;ve ever spent any time watching ants, you&#8217;ll know what I mean. It is truly astonishing. </p>
<p>Back to the ants at hand&#8230; I always do my best to avoid killing unnecessarily. After all, the ants aren&#8217;t trying to make your life more difficult by invading your home — they&#8217;re just doing what ants do. Looking for food, or water or shelter from the elements. Often I find that a good cleaning of the area is enough to slow their numbers and then (if possible) I find the crack(s) or opening(s) that they are using and try to physically block them. For those ants that haven&#8217;t managed to retreat back from whence they came, I let them crawl onto a piece of paper or cardboard and escort them outside. <em>(This is often the point where some people roll their eyes at me.)</em> Don&#8217;t misunderstand me, I do have to kill ants on occasion. Sometimes their numbers overwhelm me, or they refuse to leave even after I&#8217;ve done all the steps I outlined. In those cases, I prefer to simply squish them. I don&#8217;t use any pesticides or harsh chemicals in my home if I don&#8217;t absolutely have to.</p>
<p>I was a bit thrown by the situation that presented itself today though because these were not the tiny black ants that I was used to dealing with. These were much larger and their mouthparts looked large enough to be painful if they decided to bite. I decided to just work around them carefully, removing everything from the counter and the sink, cleaning as I went. As they began to retreat, it became clear where they were coming in and I set about blocking the cracks and escorting the stragglers outside. I&#8217;m happy to report that within a couple of hours the situation was mostly resolved! And with only one ant death — an accident on my part. </p>
<p>So, what is the moral? Well, I suppose it&#8217;s that sometimes it&#8217;s not necessary to squish and spray the insects that find their way into our homes. Or, perhaps it&#8217;s that despite the inconvenience of having to drop everything and rearrange my afternoon, my kitchen has never looked better! *GRIN*</p>
<p>I really was quite impressed with the size of the ants we had today, but only in comparison to the size of the ones we usually get. I&#8217;ve watched enough ants out on the trail to know that they can get much, <em>much</em> larger. Check out this (as of yet) unidentified species:</p>
<p><a title="very large ant species" href="/assets/content/20110719/blog_lg-20110719-8111.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110719/blog-20110719-8101.jpg" alt="very large ant species" width="440" height="550"></a><span class="caption">This photo is just to show you a size comparison next to a penny. *Click on the photo to see a nicer image of this impressive ant.* <em>I&#8217;m very relieved to report that thus far I have only found these ants traveling solo&#8230;</em><em> I can only imagine what a large colony would look like!</em></span><strong><em><br></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><br></em></strong><strong><em>Anyone else currently coping with ants in their house?</em></strong></p>

											<p>After <a href="/a-spring-in-my-summer-step" target="_blank">hyping my fantastic walk on Wednesday</a>, I promised I&#8217;d share it with you all today (Thursday), but as I&#8217;m not getting to posting this until midnight, no one will even read this until Friday! *sigh*</p>
<p>Sorry, everybody. It was cloudy and cool again today and (apparently) I have no will power when it comes to such matters. Now I&#8217;m about two days behind on other stuff that needed my attention. But, thinking over my memories of the past two days&#8217; walks, I can honestly say I have no regrets! *GRIN* </p>
<p>And now, on to the good stuff&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Western Gray Squirrel, drinking" href="/assets/content/20110714/blog_lg-20110714-1008.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110714/blog-20110714-1006.jpg" alt="Western Gray Squirrel, drinking" width="440" height="550"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="center">In the summer months, I keep a few containers filled with water outside our cabin. There are increasingly few water sources for birds and mammals as the seasonal creek shrinks and slows to a trickle in some spots. </p>
<p class="center">In addition to several bird species (including a Cooper&#8217;s Hawk!), I have also seen deer, fox, bobcat, coyote, rabbit and squirrel availing themselves. </p>
<p class="center">This Western Gray Squirrel <em>(Sciurus griseus)</em> was busy getting a drink as I stepped outside for my walk. *Be sure to click on the image for an amusing bonus shot.* <em>You lookin&#8217; at me??!</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="leafhopper nymph" href="/assets/content/20110714/blog_lg-20110714-0988.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110714/blog-20110714-0988.jpg" alt="leafhopper nymph" width="440" height="550"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="center">In the active months of summer, it can be hard to get past the front of my cabin withougt being distracted by some new arthropod.</p>
<p class="center">In this case, the wooden porch railing was hosting something otherworldy!</p>
<p><span class="center">This is the immature (nymph) stage of some leafhopper (<a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/146" target="_blank">Family Cicadellidae</a>) species. Up close, It&#8217;s very impressive looking  — with that spiked tail  — but its actual size is all of about 2 to 3 millimeters. </span></p>
<p><span class="center"><br></span></p>
<p><a title="bee sleeping in Oleander flower" href="/assets/content/20110714/blog_lg-20110714-1045.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110714/blog-20110714-1045.jpg" alt="bee sleeping in Oleander flower" width="440" height="550"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="center">One of the best parts about cool weather in the summer months is that many of these insects will slow down considerably.</p>
<p class="center">Looking for resting bees hanging out in the center of flowers is one of my favorite pastimes.</p>
<p class="center">I would have stayed longer taking more photographs of this bee (no ID yet!) resting in a white Oleander bloom, but one of my neighbors was apparently becoming quite agitated&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Western Gray Squirrel, on alert" href="/assets/content/20110714/blog_lg-20110714-1024.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110714/blog-20110714-1024.jpg" alt="Western Gray Squirrel, on alert" width="440" height="550"></a></p>
<p class="center"> </p>
<p class="center">Another gray squirrel had climbed high into the bare branches of an olive tree, twitching its tail and loudly alerting everything to my presence. </p>
<p class="center">I tried to assure the squirrel that I was not even remotely worth all the fuss. </p>
<p><span class="center">But the yammering continued and I decided to peaceably move along. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="California Poppy, late in the season" href="/assets/content/20110714/blog_lg-20110714-1064.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110714/blog-20110714-1064.jpg" alt="California Poppy, late in the season" width="440" height="550"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="center">One of the increasingly few remaining California Poppies still blooming this late in the season. </p>
<p><span class="center">The eye-popping orange is even more startling amidst the browning backdrop of our summer hillsides. </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p class="center">I stopped to photograph this sluggish Fence Lizard <em>(Sceloporus occidentalis longipes)</em>. </p>
<p class="center">Every time the light shifted and became a little brighter, I would glance skyward to see if the sun was finally going to successfully break through the clouds. I held my breath, hoping the cloud cover would hold.</p>
<p class="center"> I glanced down and realized that the lizard was looking up too&#8230; I&#8217;m guessing it was eagerly awaiting that very moment. <em></em></p>
<p class="center"><em>Sun is like coffee for lizards&#8230; their day gets off to a slow start without it. </em></p>
<p class="center"><em><br></em></p>
<p><a title="Tailed Copper on California Sagebrush, ventral" href="/assets/content/20110714/blog_lg-20110714-1146.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110714/blog-20110714-1146.jpg" alt="Taile Copper on California Sagebrush, ventral" width="440" height="550"></a></p>
<p class="center"> </p>
<p class="center">I turned to inspect a large patch of California Sagebrush <em>(Artemisia californica)</em> and struck gold&#8230; well, COPPER actually! </p>
<p class="center">This female Tailed Copper<em> (Lycaena arota)</em> was insanely cooperative and let me get close to take some beautiful photos. </p>
<p class="center">Then, she really outdid herself&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Tailed Copper on California Sagebrush, dorsal" href="/assets/content/20110714/blog_lg-20110714-1178.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110714/blog-20110714-1178.jpg" alt="Tailed Copper on California Sagebrush, dorsal" width="440" height="550"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="center">&#8230;and turned to show off the pretty pattern on the top of her wings. </p>
<p class="center"><em>How do you say &#8220;thank you&#8221; in butterfly?</em> *GRIN* </p>
<p class="center">When I passed this same spot on the way home, I thought she was <em>still</em> sitting there. But, it turned out to be a male this time. Coincidence? Or was he also waiting, just hoping that she would return? </p>
<p> </p>

<p class="center">A frustrating moment at the end of my very lovely walk&#8230; </p>
<p class="center">There on the ground among the brightly colored eucalyptus leaves was more balloon garbage. </p>
<p class="center">I wrote about my rather strong feelings on this subject in <a href="/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly" target="_blank">this post from last May</a>. Along with this item, I also picked up a latex glove <em>(ewww&#8230;)</em> and several other random bits of plastic. </p>

											<p><a title="moonrise over hillside" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6370.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6370.jpg" alt="moonrise over hillside" width="680" height="340"></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, in the late afternoon, I headed out the door for a walk. I was feeling good and one of the first sights I saw was the faint outline of the moon rising above the hills, which are currently decked out with the pale orange blooms of monkey flower (<em>Diplacus aurantiacus</em>, I think). Usually, by the time I notice the moon in the daytime, it is already fairly high in the sky&#8230; it was cool to capture a few shots of it nearer to the horizon. </p>
<p>I decided to take the road that parallels the seasonal creek. The oaks that grow down there are so magical. And the way it looks when the sunlight streams through the dense canopy is something that my camera never seems quite able to capture. It looked something like this&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="oak woodland light" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6383.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6383.jpg" alt="oak woodland light" width="429" height="600"></a></p>
<p>As I was walking, I heard a noise coming from the dense plant growth next to the creek. I looked down and saw this tiny bundle of brown feathers struggling to keep its balance and grip on the twig where it perched. It failed and tumbled down, disappearing into the foliage. I assumed it might be a juvenile bird and so I waited very quietly and patiently to see if it would return. I was delighted when this <em>very young</em> <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/song_sparrow/id" target="_blank">Song Sparrow</a> <em>(Melospiza melodia)</em> reemerged!!</p>
<p><a title="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6415.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6415.jpg" alt="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>The photos aren&#8217;t fantastic due to the heavy shade cover, but as you can see it is in the early stages of feather growth — the wings are nowhere close to their eventual full length and the tail is practically nonexistent! Sweet little thing that it was, it sat there and made the most endearing peeping noises over and over (and over!) again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6408.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6408.jpg" alt="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>Even though the juvenile didn&#8217;t seem to mind my company, I didn&#8217;t stay too long because I assumed that my presence was probably keeping the parent(s) from returning with food. [Sure enough, when I was walking by the same spot again on my way home, I saw one of the parents flying away from the clump of vegetation where the juvenile was still &#8220;peeping&#8221; away.]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="balloon trash" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6501_6483.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6501_6483.jpg" alt="balloon trash" width="680" height="420"></a><span class="caption">Today&#8217;s trash has been brought to you by the letters &#8220;G-R-E-E-N  L-A-N-T-E-R-N&#8221; and the numbers &#8220;6-17-11&#8221;. <br>The title and release date of an upcoming superhero film.</span></p>
<p>So, in this case, &#8220;the bad &amp; the ugly&#8221; part of my walk were the same thing: TRASH. We live in a pretty remote area of the canyon and there is relatively little human and vehicle traffic. Nevertheless, every time I go out for a walk, I bring a bag with me and never fail to find new bits of refuse which I pick-up and take home. The constant winds in the canyon must blow a lot of stuff our way, some things get washed down the creek when we have heavy rains, and some of it undoubtedly gets thrown or falls out of cars traveling on the main road. I try not to get up on my soap box too often, but this issue makes me so disgusted. Balloons seem to push my buttons even more than other things&#8230; I think because they are just so superfluous. The epitome of a single-use, non-essential, impulse item that people don&#8217;t seem to think twice about. They are insidiously designed to escape and travel long distances, often ending up in the mountains or the oceans. Had I not picked it up, the <em>best case</em> scenario for this balloon would be that it continued to break down into smaller and smaller bits of plastic that scatter through the environment. The <em>worst case</em> scenario is that one of the many critters here in the canyon would mistake it for food and try to eat it — a situation which can have dire consequences for the animal. </p>
<p>For those of you who take regular walks in natural areas, I&#8217;d like to ask you to consider carrying a small bag in your pocket or with your gear so that if you run across these bits of garbage you can remove them. I know it&#8217;s only a very small solution to an overwhelming problem, but I truly believe that every little bit helps.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for putting up with my rant. May your Saturday be full of the &#8220;good&#8221; and none of the &#8220;bad &amp; ugly&#8221;!</strong></p>
