											<p><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110709/blog-20110709-1421.jpg" alt="Tailed Copper (Lycaena arota)" width="600" height="600"></p>
<p>Before moving to our cabin here in the canyon, I never had the opportunity to observe the <a href="http://www.botwf.org/page213.html" target="_blank">Tailed Copper <em>(Lycaena arota)</em></a>. <a href="http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recNum=BU0074]" target="_blank">E-nature.com </a> states that the species&#8217; range extends from &#8220;S. Oregon south to S. California, east to edge of Great Plains, north to S. Wyoming, and south to central New Mexico.&#8221; They are not uncommon butterflies, but are reportedly often very localized in their distribution which may make them more difficult to find. According to Jeffrey Glassberg&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Butterflies-through-Binoculars-Western-Glassberg/dp/0195106695" target="_blank">Butterflies Through Binoculars: The West</a></em>, they are &#8220;most frequently encountered along streamsides and other water courses through foothill woodlands, but also in chaparral and oak openings, sagebrush steppes, and high mountain meadows.&#8221; Fred Heath&#8217;s <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Southern-California-Butterflies/dp/087842475X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1310268219&amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">An Introduction to Southern California Butterflies</a></em> makes specific mention of their fondness for &#8220;well-watered mountain canyons &#8230; such as Little Dalton Canyon &amp; Evie Canyon&#8221; (located west and east of our home, respectively). I wouldn&#8217;t say that I have ever seen large numbers of this species, but every year (reliably!) there are a few that camp out near the house and can be seen from late May into July. </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110709/blog-20110709-0528_1140.jpg" alt="Tailed Copper (Lycaena arota)" width="680" height="335"></p>
<p>The above image shows the ventral (underside) view of a male (left) and female (right). While these two individuals&#8217; coloration look somewhat distinct, I don&#8217;t actually believe that you can tell the sexes apart from this view. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110709/blog-20110709-0516_0895.jpg" alt="Tailed Copper (Lycaena arota)" width="680" height="418"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As can be seen in this image showing the dorsal (topside) view of a couple of males, they are usually a brown/copper color with an occasional purplish tinge and not much in the way of distinctive patterning. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110709/blog-20110709-1146_1147.jpg" alt="Tailed Copper (Lycaena arota)" width="680" height="419"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen many males, but thus far, only one female. I felt I was lucky to be able to get these few nice images of her nectaring at <a href="http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=4140" target="_blank">Toyon <em>(Heteromeles arbutifolia)</em></a>. If you can get a clear view of the dorsal surface, the orange-y wing pattern is quite distinctive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110709/blog-20110709-1617_5017_6395.jpg" alt="Ribes species" width="680" height="335"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While adult butterflies will nectar at a number of different kinds of plants, their larva is dependent on those in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribes" target="_blank"><em>Ribes</em></a> genus — specifically gooseberry and currant. Here are a few of the varieties growing here in the canyon. (I confess that I don&#8217;t have firm IDs for these yet&#8230; my ability to identify plants to species is still a work in progress.) While I have searched through foliage many times in early Spring, hoping for the opportunity to find the eggs and/or caterpillars to photograph and observe, I have yet to be successful. I couldn&#8217;t even find an online photo of their larva to show you, so my guess is that they are not so easy to discover. <a href="http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recNum=BU0074" target="_blank">E-nature.com</a> describes them as follows, &#8220;caterpillar green, darker toward head, with fine double white line down back, yellowish line down side, and covered with minute yellowish-white hair&#8221;. </p>
<p>At about 1-inch in size, they are among the smaller butterflies in this area. Fortunately, the males have a very conspicuous habit of choosing an elevated perch (such as a small shrub) and then patrolling the area, investigating any passing insect (or other critter), presumably in the hopes of finding or attracting a female. </p>
<p><em><strong>If you live an area where these butterflies do, I&#8217;d love to hear your experiences with them. And, if you have yet to find one for yourself, I hope this post will prove helpful!</strong></em></p>

											<p>More images and thoughts from my walk at sundown yesterday&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="sky, tree &amp; moon triptych" href="/assets/content/20110704/blog_lg-20110704-0374_0173_0210.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110704/blog-20110704-0374_0173_0210.jpg" alt="sky, tree &amp; moon triptych" width="680" height="565"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="center">Everywhere I looked the sky was doing something different. </p>
<p class="center">Washes of color and fast-moving clouds. </p>
<p class="center">Swallows dancing through it all. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Western Fence Lizard, sunset profile" href="/assets/content/20110704/blog_lg-20110704-0017.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110704/blog-20110704-0017.jpg" alt="Western Fence Lizard, sunset profile" width="680" height="453"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="center">Tearing myself away from the views above, I found plenty of interest down on the ground.</p>
<p class="center"><a href="http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/s.o.longipes.html" target="_blank">Fence Lizard <em>(Sceloporus occidentalis longipes)</em></a> — such beautiful creatures.</p>
<p class="center">After approaching slowly and gradually, I was duly rewarded with an amazing series of shots. </p>
<p><span class="center">I made sure to say &#8220;thank you&#8221; when we parted ways.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="center"><a title="Phainopepla &amp; branches" href="/assets/content/20110704/blog_lg-20110704-9977.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110704/blog-20110704-9977.jpg" alt="Phainopepla &amp; branches" width="680" height="255"></a></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="center">The <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/phainopepla/id" target="_blank">Phainopeplas <em>(Phainopepla nitens)</em></a> are so numerous this year. </span><span class="center"></span><span class="center"></span></p>
<p><span class="center">Everywhere in the bare branches are crested pairs — I imagine their nests are hidden in the foliage below. </span></p>
<p><span class="center">Quail sputtered loudly from the stands of dry thistle and brush as I passed.</span></p>
<p><span class="center">The shrill begging cries of a newly fledged hawk demanded my attention over and over again.</span><span class="center"></span></p>
<p><span class="center">I think (as I have thousands of times before) that birds are pure magic. <br></span></p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><span class="center">Even after the sun had set from view, the sky remained drenched in lovely shades.</span></p>
<p><span class="center">I took the opportunity to photograph some stunning plant silhouettes. </span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><span class="center">It was almost 8:30 PM when I neared home&#8230;</span></p>
<p>Just enough light to still make out the potential dangers while wandering around in the hills. </p>
<p>Not quite enough light to get the camera to achieve focus though.</p>
<p>  Not to worry&#8230; I like the soft, brush-stroked look of this rattlesnake rendering.</p>

											<p>The sun has been BLAZING lately. I try my best to find creative ways to work with this element when it comes to photography. I&#8217;m including a few images that I took of the setting sun shining through a mosaic of <a href="http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=5348" target="_blank">Laurel Sumac <em>(Malosma laurina)</em></a> leaves. The effect in-person turned out to be much more spectacular than I was able to capture with these images. As long as I had them open in Photoshop though, I decided to play around a bit. Has anyone else ever experimented with the &#8220;Invert&#8221; command? It inverts the colors in any image, producing an end product that is similar to the way a film negative might appear. In most instances, I find the effect to be too harsh and obviously computer-generated looking. However, with a select group of scenery images and also with many abstract shots, it can produce some unique outcomes that I actually like. Click on the original photos below to see their color inverted. When I saw how these turned out, my thoughts immediately turned to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batik" target="_blank">batik</a> — a wax-dyeing technique. Hmmm&#8230;. maybe that&#8217;s just me?</p>
<p> </p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/hello-again-old-friend/">Hello Again, Old Friend!</a></h3>					
											<p>In the still gray hours of early afternoon, I walked with a new friend up the fire road behind our cabin today. I mentioned that two years ago I had the pleasure of photographing a blooming <a href="http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=1302" target="_blank">Plummer&#8217;s Mariposa Lily <em>(Calochortus plummerae)</em></a> right near where we stood. Despite my best efforts, I hadn&#8217;t managed to find anything in the same spot last year, and even as I said all this, I was scanning for signs of the obscure plant. No luck! </p>
<p>That might have been the end of it, but on our return trip past the same little stretch I turned to point out something of interest and (lucky me!) found myself staring directly at one! A single flower washed in shades of pink and yellow, atop a spindly stem lacking any leaves. The Plummer&#8217;s Mariposa Lily is endemic to California and it is classified as endangered or rare by many sources.</p>

<p>Our long walk produced many wonderful sightings and lots (and lots!) of great conversation about the local plants and wildlife. But, I think for both of us, this encounter stood out as special. I am so excited to walk back up tomorrow and take a few more pics. And the day after that&#8230; and, well&#8230;. probably the day after that too! </p>

<p> </p>
<p>One of the definite highlights of my trip to El Dorado Regional Park a couple weeks ago was a beautiful <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/24573" target="_blank">Western Tiger Swallowtail <em>(Papilio rutulus)</em></a> which repeatedly landed on a close-by patch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monardella" target="_blank"><em>Monardella</em> sp.</a> (commonly referred to as Coyote Mint) and then stayed there like someone was paying it to do so. For me and my fellow arthropod enthusiast (Chris), this was like hitting the jackpot.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>These butterflies are impressively large, but in my experience, they have a frustrating habit of flying around in large circles, then landing just long enough for you to lock in your camera settings and get them framed nicely. Then, you go to press the shutter and find that there&#8217;s no butterfly in the viewfinder anymore.<em> Where did it go?! </em>you mutter to yourself&#8230; You look around, spy it landing on another flower a little ways off, and the process starts all over again.</p>
<p>But&#8230; not this particular butterfly. It seemed quite smitten with this one small grouping of flowers and though it often flitted away for a few seconds, it reliably came back to the same spot over and over again, giving us both ample opportunity to get many photos in a row and even play around a bit with our viewing angle and composition. It was heavenly!!! </p>

<p>As is so often the case when I sit down to closely examine my nature images, I discover things that would be very difficult (or impossible) to discern in the field. As I began preparing the photos for this post, I was definitely working under the presumption that I had only photographed a single butterfly. Somehow, the repeated act of it returning to the exact same group of flowers just made me <em>(and I&#8217;m guessing Chris too)</em> presume that it was the same swallowtail each time. Apparently&#8230; not so!! If you look closely at the images, you can see that there are several notches on the edge of the upper wing of the first butterfly (probably caused by a close call with a hungry bird?) that are not found on the butterfly in the remaining images. Also, if you check out the side-by-side comparison shot I put together below, you can see the subtle differences in the markings themselves.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> I am indebted to Chris for his help in providing me with an ID for the lovely purple flowers. Also, he has put up a wonderful post of his own about our day together at El Dorado — <a href="http://blog.cmalloryphotos.com/2011/06/el-dorado.html" target="_blank">check it out</a>! </p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/eucalyptus-izing/">Eucalyptus-izing</a></h3>					
											<p>It&#8217;s nearing the end of a very long day&#8230; About an hour ago, I said good-bye to my husband as he departed for a week-long business trip to Australia. Sadly, he probably won&#8217;t get to see much more than whatever is visible from his hotel, but I still hope he manages to have a bit of an adventure and see a few cool sights during his travels. </p>
<p>On my drive home, I found myself thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus" target="_blank">Eucalyptus</a> — a genus of tree that grows prolifically in Australia where it is a native. In southern California, these trees are planted so frequently and have thrived here for so many years that it&#8217;s hard for me to not consider them a permanent part of the landscape. And yet&#8230; there was a time when not a trace of Eucalyptus would have been found on this continent. Odd to think about. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Eucalyptus leaf" href="/assets/content/20110611/blog_lg-20110611-2997.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110611/blog-20110611-2997.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus leaf" width="680" height="340"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This leaf could have been photographed anywhere. </p>
<p>In truth, it was just one of the many in the canyon that decorate the ground along the trails behind my house&#8230; but, it <em>could</em> have been Australia. How would you know the difference? A leaf is a leaf is a leaf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Black Bear claw marks on Eucalyptus" href="/assets/content/20110611/blog_lg-20110611-6229.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110611/blog-20110611-6229.jpg" alt="Black Bear claw marks on Eucalytpus" width="680" height="340"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a photo that could never be taken in Australia. </p>
<p>The multicolored trunk and peeling layers of bark wouldn&#8217;t be much of a stretch, but this particular Eucalyptus stands near our cabin and it is beautifully etched with the claw marks of one of the resident <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Black_Bear" target="_blank">Black Bear <em>(Ursus americanus)</em></a>. Despite the misleading name often attributed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala" target="_blank">Koala</a>, there are no bears in Australia.</p>
<p> Around here, the bears appear to regularly climb and mark the Eucalyptus trees. From the evidence I&#8217;ve seen, I gather that at least some of the time they are searching for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_honey_bee" target="_blank">Honey Bee <em>(Apis mellifera)</em></a> nests to ransack. A bee species which, by the way, originates from Europe, Asia and Africa. </p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; always so interesting to ponder the increasing convergence of introduced and native wildlife here in California.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&#8217;t really going anywhere with all of this&#8230; Sorry! Just musing to myself and trying to share a little something with y&#8217;all before I crash for the night. <em><strong>Wishing everyone an enjoyable weekend and hoping that nature figures in your plans somewhere!</strong></em></p>
<p>[EDIT: After doing a bit more reading, I thought I should probably clarify that while they may all be casually referred to as &#8220;eucalyptus&#8221;, there are actually three potential genera — <em>Eucalyptus,</em><em><em> Angophora</em></em> and <em><em>Corymbia — </em></em>that make up this group of plants. I haven&#8217;t attempted to identify the various species of eucalyptus around my place&#8230;. yet! Perhaps that will be the subject of a future blog post.]</p>

<p>First off, my apologies to The Beatles for usurping the title of their song for my nerdy, semi-humorous, botanical purposes. *GRIN* This is a photo I took yesterday of a pair of mating <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/71561" target="_blank">Soft-winged Flower Beetles (Dasytinae)</a>. <strong>Be sure to click on the image for a close-up of the beetles.</strong> I discovered them nestled deep inside the center of a <em>Diplacus aurantiacus</em> blossom. <em><a href="http://www.calflora.org/cgi-bin/species_query.cgi?where-calrecnum=5489" target="_blank">Diplacus aurantiacus</a></em> is also referenced as <em>Mimulus aurantiacus,</em> and is known commonly as Orange Bush Monkey Flower or Sticky Monkey Flower. </p>
<p>This is a very common and prolific flower here in the canyon. As it is extremely drought-resistant, it easily covers the hillsides in a bright, orange perfusion of blossoms and continues to bloom long after most of the other Spring wildflowers have peaked. <span class="A11" style="color: #125c25;"></span></p>

											<p>I&#8217;ve been struggling to finish up the next installment of my retrospective on our trip to Washington last month. (Not struggling because it is unenjoyable, but because I can&#8217;t seem to decide which images to share&#8230; I&#8217;m terrible like that when it comes to making up my mind.) Meanwhile, ever since we returned home, the lure to be outside for large portions of the day grows stronger and stronger. Spring is in full swing and the sight of deer peeking out of tall grasses and the sounds of birds singing their best courtship arias are hard things to resist. (Not to mention the bevy of awesome insects that have arrived and promise a new discovery nearly every day!!) I promised myself that I wouldn&#8217;t share any of my recent pics until I&#8217;d finished with the tales of our trip — BUT WHO AM I KIDDING??? Some things just need to be shared&#8230; especially with friends. I hope you enjoy and be sure to click on the images for embiggened viewing!</p>
