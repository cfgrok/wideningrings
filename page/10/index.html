<p>As I leisurely browsed through sky images yesterday, I stopped to reminisce on my photos from January 27th of last year. A short walk behind our cabin and up the fire road (a plowed service road meant for fire and other emergency vehicles) brings me to a great west-facing overlook spot. This is where I shoot a great majority of the skies in my archives. Some days (like this one) it&#8217;s honestly hard for me to comprehend the beauty I&#8217;m seeing&#8230; </p>

<p>The view to the east was equally spectacular&#8230; but in a much more subtle way. The sky reflected back the colors of the sunset in an amazing pastel gradation suspended above the hills&#8230;</p>

											<p>In the last few days, all of our lovely, unseasonably cool weather and cloud-filled skies have started to evaporate. Those who know me will understand my disappointment. I am just not a fan of the &#8220;blue sky&#8221; days that are so common here much of the year. What I mean by &#8220;blue sky&#8221;, is exactly what it sounds like — nothing but blue&#8230; not even a hint of clouds to break the monotony of that wide expanse. The light is constant, bright and glaring. Ugh!</p>
<p>I like movement in my skies&#8230; I like the way that clouds change and shift the light so that from one moment to the next everything you view is transitioning&#8230; making new shapes, new colors, new moods. In order to console myself a bit I decided to do some vicarious cloud-watching by sifting through my ENDLESS stack of sky images. <em>(Seriously, I could have a blog devoted to nothing but showing pics of the sky every day and I would currently have enough images to last me years and years.) </em></p>
<p>I picked this one out to share with you guys. So, come on&#8230; join in the fun! What do you see in this wonderful sky? What can your imagination turn these fantastic shapes into? (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don&#8217;t click</span></strong> on the image or read any further until you&#8217;ve got it all worked out in your head!)</p>

<p>What I saw was an epic battle between a Great White Shark and a mythical fire-breathing dragon! Can&#8217;t see it for yourself?! OK, go ahead&#8230; <strong>click on the photo</strong> to see my (barely) artistic interpretation. *GRIN*</p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/theres-no-place-like-home/">There&#8217;s No Place Like Home</a></h3>					
											<p>Yesterday, I was heading back to bed to relax and read for awhile with a hot cup of tea&#8230; but, in doing so I cast a passing glance out the east-facing window of my bedroom and instantly knew that I wouldn&#8217;t be getting to that herbal tea anytime soon.</p>
<p>Let me back up for a minute and say a few things&#8230; Ever since we moved here to the canyon, I haven&#8217;t been terribly inclined to visit other places. Previously, we had lived in a truly soul-sucking environment — the suburban apartment complex. Perhaps that is a happy housing experience for some, but not for us. Every weekend that we could, we made a mad dash for someplace more wild and lovely, and in doing so we were often heading down to the coast or up into the mountains. But, once we moved to this surreal haven, where &#8220;wildlife&#8221; and &#8220;homelife&#8221; intersect seamlessly every day, a lot of the motivation for getting in a vehicle and sitting on the freeway to get somewhere else kind of vanished. Now, some people might think that things would get boring wandering around the same piece of land day in and day out&#8230; but it never does for me. I love being able to get to know this area so intimately. Having a feel for when certain bird species will return, where certain wildflowers will poke up through the ground in Spring, understanding the cyclical quality of how the light changes as it filters through the canyon each day in winter vs. summer&#8230; these are things that you can only grasp after years of living in a place and wandering the same trails day after day. While I certainly still feel the thrill of excitement that comes from traveling and investigating new places, I believe there are always new discoveries to be made wherever you are if you are willing to look hard and long enough. It is only rarely that I go outside in the canyon and don&#8217;t come away with some brand new bit of information that I never knew before. <em>For instance&#8230; Woodpeckers and thrushes seem to swallow the fruit from the olive trees whole — pit and all! — while finches and sparrows peck at them and swallow little pieces. Or&#8230; Cottontail scat is very different looking in Spring vs. Fall — small, dark and moist vs. larger, light-colored and dry. </em>Anyway&#8230; Why am I going on at length about all of this? Well, because if I wasn&#8217;t so attuned to my surroundings and I didn&#8217;t know the view out my window like the back of my hand, I&#8217;m certain the following sighting never would have occurred.</p>
<p>So, where was I? Oh, yes&#8230; Cup of tea in hand, I stopped dead in my tracks, scrutinizing a spot of bare ground under a patch of olive trees about 50 feet away. The ground rippled ever so slightly. A sinuous shimmer of banded earth. I instantly turned on my heel, grabbed my camera and hurried to put on a pair of shoes. I walked quickly (but carefully) to the spot behind the cabin and scanned the area until I saw it — a large rattlesnake slowly making its way across the mostly brown earth. My first thought was that this was a really good-sized snake. [According to <a href="http://www.californiaherps.com/snakes/pages/c.o.helleri.html" target="_blank">CaliforniaHerps.com</a>, the average adult length for the subspecies of rattlesnake that occurs in this area — the Southern Pacific Rattlesnake <em>(Crotalus oreganus helleri)</em> — is &#8220;30 – 44 inches long, sometimes up to 54 inches&#8221;. After doing a little post-sighting calculation, using the photographs that I took as a guide, I went back out and measured some of the adjacent rocks. Not an exact science, to be sure, but using that data I arrived at an approximate measurement for the snake of <strong>47 to 50 inches</strong>!!] It certainly made for an impressive sight and (despite my affection for these snakes) a bit intimidating too. A curled-up snake, if given its space is never something that concerns me too much, but with an active snake I think it&#8217;s really important to keep an eye on them and make sure to leave ample distance between yourself and the snake — especially when a portion of your attention (and visual field!) is compromised by photographing or filming. I stayed several feet behind the snake and moved slowly so as not to alarm or intimidate it. My presence seemed to go completely ignored, which is exactly what I aim for when shooting in the field. After several moments out in the open, during which time it investigated small clumps of plants and bits of wood, occasionally flicking its tongue to &#8220;taste&#8221; the air, it finally disappeared into denser foliage. I am definitely NOT foolish enough to follow a rattler into an area where I can&#8217;t keep track of it, so I said a sincere &#8220;thank you&#8221; (as I always do with accommodating wildlife) and headed back inside. I was pretty sure my tea would need to be re-heated, but what a very small price to pay for such a lasting memory. </p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/skunk/">Skunk!!!</a></h3>					
											<p>Sadly, I&#8217;m still feeling sick&#8230; but, it was definitely necessary for me to get outside for a little while today. My husband (who&#8217;s also been a bit sick) was kind enough to join me on a mellow walk down to the creek and back. We checked up on the newts&#8230; listened to the birds calling&#8230; I occasionally stopped from time to time to peer at some small beetle or spider. Then, I saw a flash of movement in the creek bed, several feet below the height of the road we were walking on. A somewhat alarmed looking skunk hurried up the embankment on the opposite side of the creek and crashed into the dense foliage. We watched it until it went out of view and then I babbled on about what a wonderful sighting we&#8217;d just had. You see, though we&#8217;ve lived here in the canyon for seven years and have had a few skunk sightings here and there, mostly we are aware of their regular presence solely by the lingering odor that often wafts through the air. The few times that we have seen them, it&#8217;s always been while driving on the road (usually at night) and then we only a get a few seconds to observe them before they slink off out of sight. This was by far the best opportunity we&#8217;d had to really watch one of these lovely creatures! We were about to move on, but out of the corner of my eye, I saw <em>another one</em> emerge from the foliage a little distance behind where the last one had disappeared. Perhaps because we had not startled this one, it was more nonchalant and we quietly watched it forage and dig around for a much longer time before it too finally disappeared from view. It was near sundown and far too dark and shady by the creek for there to be much hope of good photographs, but I did take several video clips and I thought I&#8217;d share a few still images from that footage, just so that you all can share in the experience&#8230; even if it&#8217;s just a bit of blurry black &amp; white. (*grin*)</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="font-family: InaiMathi;"><span style="font-size: small;"><strong></strong></span></span></span>Lately, I have been feeling the strong urge to CREATE&#8230; poetry, art, music, textiles&#8230; something! </p>
<p>But, again, the <a href="/the-change-that-s-coming" target="_blank">perfectionist tendencies</a> that I have always struggled with loom large over the path I&#8217;d like to walk. I have to keep reminding myself that how good something is doesn&#8217;t really matter. (What does &#8220;good&#8221; mean anyway?) It is the daily process of <em>creating</em> that I am craving&#8230; not fame, fortune or approval. (OK&#8230; if I&#8217;m being totally honest, I probably am still craving approval a little&#8230; but, I&#8217;m trying to get past that one.) </p>
<p>So, I&#8217;ve been attempting to move <em>forward</em> by going <em>backward</em>. I&#8217;ve been looking at all the things I created as a child. Hoping to rediscover that freedom of expression that seems to elude me these days. I know there was a certain self-confidence I possessed then&#8230; an assuredness that whatever streamed forth from my mind and from my hand was as it was meant to be.</p>
<p>I hope to not only start creating again in earnest, but to share much of it here. For now, I&#8217;ve posted this painting which was done many, many years ago. (I&#8217;m not sure how old I was, but I suspect that I was younger than 13.) I love the flowing lines and open space. The primary colors. The organic sky and oddly geometric bird. Mostly I love the place it came from&#8230; a place I&#8217;m hoping to reconnect with. </p>

											<p>As I was stuck in bed again today, I decided to indulge in one of my favorite pastimes where I go back through my photo archives and check out what was happening on that day&#8217;s date in years gone by. One of the reasons that it is such a bummer to be sick right now is because this is a truly excellent time of year to be observing wildlife — especially in the world of spiders and insects. Apparently, May 19, 2009 was an especially good day for this, and I thought I would share just a small fraction of the arthropods I photographed. </p>

(It&#8217;s also possible that this is a Brown Widow, but I think I got the ID right&#8230; I hope my fellow bug enthusiasts will let me know if you disagree!) </span></p>
<p>As if that weren&#8217;t enough critters for one afternoon, these discoveries were also made that day:</p>

<p><a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/335741" target="_blank"><em>Retocomus </em>sp.</a><em><br></em></p>
<p>I know this post was a little on the &#8220;nerdy-insect-lover&#8221; side of things, but I truly hope to interest more people in learning about their local bugs, or at least to take a few moments here to enjoy the beauty and diversity of this amazing subset of life.</p>

											<p>As I lay in bed with a sore throat, aches, pains and a nasty headache, I feel all the more grateful for the beautiful days I spent outside last week&#8230; Blech! I do NOT handle being sick well. I&#8217;m trying to be good to myself though and give my body the time it needs to rest and repair. Here&#8217;s a few pics of the local critters taking a break too&#8230; *grin*</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t stop thinking about my walk yesterday. It was the kind of day that makes you want to write about it with such perfection that everyone reading will instantly know just how you felt. I rarely posses that sort of talent&#8230; but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Oliver" target="_blank"><strong>Mary Oliver</strong></a> does. She is a true master. Her poetry never fails to speak what my heart is saying.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 class="center"><em><strong><strong>Such Singing in the Wild Branches</strong></strong></em></h3>
<div class="center"><em><strong>It was spring<br>and finally I heard him<br>among the first leaves &#8211;<br>then I saw him clutching the limb</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>in an island of shade<br>with his red-brown feathers<br>all trim and neat for the new year.<br>First, I stood still</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>and thought of nothing.<br>Then I began to listen.<br>Then I was filled with gladness &#8211;<br>and that&#8217;s when it happened,</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>when I seemed to float,<br>to be, myself, a wing or a tree &#8211;<br>and I began to understand<br>what the bird was saying,</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>and the sands in the glass<br>stopped<br>for a pure white moment<br>while gravity sprinkled upward</strong><br></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>like rain, rising,<br>and in fact<br>it became difficult to tell just what it was that was singing &#8211;<br>it was the thrush for sure, but it seemed</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>not a single thrush, but himself, and all his brothers,<br>and also the trees around them,<br>as well as the gliding, long-tailed clouds<br>in the perfectly blue sky &#8211; all, all of them</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>were singing.<br>And, of course, yes, so it seemed,<br>so was I.<br>Such soft and solemn and perfect music doesn&#8217;t last</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>for more than a few moments.<br>It&#8217;s one of those magical places wise people<br>like to talk about.<br>One of the things they say about it, that is true,</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>is that, once you&#8217;ve been there,<br>you&#8217;re there forever.<br>Listen, everyone has a chance.<br>Is it spring, is it morning?</strong></em></div>
<div class="center"><em><strong>Are there trees near you,<br>and does your own soul need comforting?<br>Quick, then &#8211; open the door and fly on your heavy feet; the song<br>may already be drifting away.</strong></em></div>
<div><em><strong><br></strong></em></div>

<p>Bliss. Peace. Beauty. Joy. Everything I want to have in my life! I hope that Spring is bringing all of these things to you too. We all deserve at least a little bit of this every day.</p>
