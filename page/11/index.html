											<p>OK&#8230; so I&#8217;m really skating the edge of my &#8220;one-a-day post&#8221; promise with this one&#8230; but, technically it <strong><em>is</em></strong> still Monday&#8230; for at least 30 more minutes! *smirk* I confess that I had big plans for all the stuff I was going to get done today, including a fantastic blog post. But, it was so incredibly gorgeous outside this morning that I couldn&#8217;t resist slipping on my shoes and heading up into the hills. I always tend to lose track of time when I&#8217;m outside and if I&#8217;m really in the zone, hours and hours can fly by before I realize how late it&#8217;s gotten. <strong>Some days I go out and take a walk&#8230; other days I go out and <em>the walk takes me</em>!</strong> Anyway, here&#8217;s just a few of the friends I spent time with today:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="hummingbird on olive" href="/assets/content/20110516/blog_lg-20110516-6894.jpg" target="_blank"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110516/blog-20110516-6894.jpg" alt="hummingbird on olive" width="350" height="700"></a><span class="caption">I was photographing the sky when this little jewel came and perched on an olive branch right in front of me! After studying my various birding books, I think this is a female or immature <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Costas_Hummingbird/id" target="_blank">Costa&#8217;s Hummingbird <em>(Calypte costae)</em></a>. It could also possibly be an immature <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/annas_hummingbird/id" target="_blank">Anna&#8217;s Hummingbird <em>(Calypte anna)</em></a>&#8230; the differences between the two are subtle. </span></p>
<p><a title="bumblebee on poppy" href="/assets/content/20110516/blog_lg-20110516-7105.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110516/blog-20110516-7105.jpg" alt="bumblebee on poppy" width="680" height="340"></a><span class="caption">The temperatures were a little too cool most of the day for many of the native bees to be active. (The well-known, non-native Honey Bee seems to be more acclimated to such weather and they were out in good numbers.) So, it was a real treat to get to watch this bumble bee methodically visiting one California Poppy (<em>Eschscholzia</em> sp.) after another along the side of the trail I was walking. I should probably double-check myself with my friends on <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/6/bgimage" target="_blank">BugGuide</a>, but I believe this is a <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/155753" target="_blank">California Bumble Bee <em>(Bombus californicus)</em></a>.</span></p>

<p>Sorry for the late post&#8230; it&#8217;s been a busy weekend! I spent the first part of today in my mother-in-law&#8217;s impressively lush garden. We had a bit of rain, then some sun and the most amazing puffy white clouds that filled the sky in a way that couldn&#8217;t help but make a person smile. (I found a bevy of interesting things in her yard and hope to be sharing a few of those discoveries soon!) </p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/the-good-the-bad-the-ugly/">The Good, The Bad &#038; The Ugly</a></h3>					
											<p><a title="moonrise over hillside" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6370.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6370.jpg" alt="moonrise over hillside" width="680" height="340"></a></p>
<p>Yesterday, in the late afternoon, I headed out the door for a walk. I was feeling good and one of the first sights I saw was the faint outline of the moon rising above the hills, which are currently decked out with the pale orange blooms of monkey flower (<em>Diplacus aurantiacus</em>, I think). Usually, by the time I notice the moon in the daytime, it is already fairly high in the sky&#8230; it was cool to capture a few shots of it nearer to the horizon. </p>
<p>I decided to take the road that parallels the seasonal creek. The oaks that grow down there are so magical. And the way it looks when the sunlight streams through the dense canopy is something that my camera never seems quite able to capture. It looked something like this&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="oak woodland light" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6383.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6383.jpg" alt="oak woodland light" width="429" height="600"></a></p>
<p>As I was walking, I heard a noise coming from the dense plant growth next to the creek. I looked down and saw this tiny bundle of brown feathers struggling to keep its balance and grip on the twig where it perched. It failed and tumbled down, disappearing into the foliage. I assumed it might be a juvenile bird and so I waited very quietly and patiently to see if it would return. I was delighted when this <em>very young</em> <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/song_sparrow/id" target="_blank">Song Sparrow</a> <em>(Melospiza melodia)</em> reemerged!!</p>
<p><a title="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6415.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6415.jpg" alt="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>The photos aren&#8217;t fantastic due to the heavy shade cover, but as you can see it is in the early stages of feather growth — the wings are nowhere close to their eventual full length and the tail is practically nonexistent! Sweet little thing that it was, it sat there and made the most endearing peeping noises over and over (and over!) again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6408.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6408.jpg" alt="juvenile song sparrow (melospiza melodia)" width="500" height="500"></a></p>
<p>Even though the juvenile didn&#8217;t seem to mind my company, I didn&#8217;t stay too long because I assumed that my presence was probably keeping the parent(s) from returning with food. [Sure enough, when I was walking by the same spot again on my way home, I saw one of the parents flying away from the clump of vegetation where the juvenile was still &#8220;peeping&#8221; away.]</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="balloon trash" href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6501_6483.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110514/blog-20110514-6501_6483.jpg" alt="balloon trash" width="680" height="420"></a><span class="caption">Today&#8217;s trash has been brought to you by the letters &#8220;G-R-E-E-N  L-A-N-T-E-R-N&#8221; and the numbers &#8220;6-17-11&#8221;. <br>The title and release date of an upcoming superhero film.</span></p>
<p>So, in this case, &#8220;the bad &amp; the ugly&#8221; part of my walk were the same thing: TRASH. We live in a pretty remote area of the canyon and there is relatively little human and vehicle traffic. Nevertheless, every time I go out for a walk, I bring a bag with me and never fail to find new bits of refuse which I pick-up and take home. The constant winds in the canyon must blow a lot of stuff our way, some things get washed down the creek when we have heavy rains, and some of it undoubtedly gets thrown or falls out of cars traveling on the main road. I try not to get up on my soap box too often, but this issue makes me so disgusted. Balloons seem to push my buttons even more than other things&#8230; I think because they are just so superfluous. The epitome of a single-use, non-essential, impulse item that people don&#8217;t seem to think twice about. They are insidiously designed to escape and travel long distances, often ending up in the mountains or the oceans. Had I not picked it up, the <em>best case</em> scenario for this balloon would be that it continued to break down into smaller and smaller bits of plastic that scatter through the environment. The <em>worst case</em> scenario is that one of the many critters here in the canyon would mistake it for food and try to eat it — a situation which can have dire consequences for the animal. </p>
<p>For those of you who take regular walks in natural areas, I&#8217;d like to ask you to consider carrying a small bag in your pocket or with your gear so that if you run across these bits of garbage you can remove them. I know it&#8217;s only a very small solution to an overwhelming problem, but I truly believe that every little bit helps.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for putting up with my rant. May your Saturday be full of the &#8220;good&#8221; and none of the &#8220;bad &amp; ugly&#8221;!</strong></p>

											<p>Have you ever thought of the words &#8220;fly&#8221; and &#8220;beautiful&#8221; in the same sentence? No?!</p>
<p>Well, let me introduce you to <em>Allograpta obliqua</em>&#8230;</p>
<p><a title="allograpta obliqua on pyracantha" href="/assets/content/20110513/blog_lg-20110513-5897.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110513/blog-20110513-5897.jpg" alt="allograpta obliqua on pyracantha" width="500" height="500"></a><span class="caption">Nectaring on Pyracantha <em>(Pyracantha angustifolia)</em> flowers.</span><br><a title="allograpta obliqua on brassica" href="/assets/content/20110513/blog_lg-20110513-7839.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110513/blog-20110513-7839.jpg" alt="allograpta obliqua on brassica" width="500" height="500"></a><span class="caption">Nectaring on Mustard <em>(Brassica</em> sp.<em>)</em> flowers.</span><br><em>Allograpta obliqua</em> can be found throughout much of North America and is a member of the family Syrphidae, collectively known as Flower Flies or Hover Flies. These names are very fitting as this fly visits a wide variety of flowers to collect nectar and is also an expert flyer with the ability to hover in one place, move sideways or backwards in flight. In addition to the fact that it is a joy to watch and is completely harmless to humans, this is a great fly to have around one&#8217;s garden. By visiting flowers it assists in pollination and it also lays its eggs on plants with aphid colonies, which are decimated by the fly&#8217;s predacious developing larvae.</p>

											<p><a title="pre-sunrise hills" href="/assets/content/20110511/blog_lg-20110511-6005.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110511/blog-20110511-6005.jpg" alt="pre-sunrise hills" width="680" height="213"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had to get up <em>really</em> early this morning in order to see my husband off on his annual trip to Minnesota for a work-related conference. As I was heading back home, enjoying a leisurely drive through the canyon, I spied a perched Red-tailed Hawk <em>(Buteo jamaicensis)</em> silhouetted against the still gray sky and decided to pull off the road to take a few pictures. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="red-tailed hawk solo" href="/assets/content/20110511/blog_lg-20110511-5994.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110511/blog-20110511-5994.jpg" alt="red-tailed hawk solo" width="400" height="500"></a></p>
<p>I walked a bit futher out onto the flat, open area which used to be a fenced pasture area for horses; now, overgrown with dense chaparral on all sides. The hawk was sitting at the top of a large eucalyptus that I knew was a regular nesting spot in previous years. Sure enough, the lone hawk was soon joined in the tree by its mate. Every few minutes or so, one of the hawks (the female, I&#8217;m fairly certain) would let loose with a loud, piercing cry — <em>keeeeeeeeee-yah</em>! — then fall silent again. Several times in a row, the female hawk would take to the air and do some brief circling just above the tree, then as she came in for a landing, the male would flap upward as if to greet her before they both settled back into their proximal perching positions. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="red-tailed hawk landing" href="/assets/content/20110511/blog_lg-20110511-5972.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110511/blog-20110511-5972.jpg" alt="red-tailed hawk landing" width="400" height="500"></a></p>
<p><a title="red-tailed hawk pair landing" href="/assets/content/20110511/blog_lg-20110511-5979.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110511/blog-20110511-5979.jpg" alt="red-tailed hawk pair landing" width="400" height="500"></a></p>
<p>I so enjoyed capturing these images of them&#8230; they were an absolute joy to watch! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110511/blog-20110511-6013.jpg" alt="red-tailed hawk pair" width="400" height="500"><span class="caption">Not a great photo, with houses and whatnot in the background, but I&#8217;m fascinated by how different their plumage looks. Red-tailed Hawks come in many, many color forms, from very pale to very dark and every variation between. I believe that the slightly larger, reddish one is the female&#8230; </span></p>
<p>Eventually, I turned away from the now quiet, stoic hawk pair. I started back to my truck, but as I walked over a small rise, I found myself staring into the eyes of a somewhat startled looking Mule Deer <em>(Odocoileus hemionus)</em>. As is often the case when they are approached slowly around our place, the deer seemed more curious about my presence than frightened.

<p>&#8230;but then actually moved closer, nearing to 40 feet or so. <br>The expression on her face was one big question mark &#8212; <em>WHO are you? WHAT are you? Whatcha&#8217; doin&#8217; standing in the middle of the road there?</em><br>Aloud, I said, &#8220;Hello, there. How&#8217;s it goin&#8217;?&#8221;<br>Her only response was an even more intense stare and a twitch of her large namesake ears.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>I watched her disappear behind my truck and then down into the sloping brush. How can you not feel like a million bucks after an encounter like that?! Quail were calling from hiding places in the dense foliage. A rabbit scampered past. I picked out the calls of California Thrasher, Phainopepla, Wrentit, Common Yellowthroat&#8230; just a few of the voices in the busy morning chatter. The sun was now cresting over the hills, its warmth and light spreading over the dark, chilly parts of the canyon. </p>

<p>I was so incredibly glad to be up early!! Happy and blessed. And maybe a little silly from lack of sleep&#8230; *grin* This last photo of me heading home is an homage to <a href="http://www.gallerydarrow.net/2011/05/love-in-mist.html" target="_blank">my friend Ro</a>, who has made an art form of rising early and sharing her morning walks.

There are <em>at least</em> two tree squirrels that live just around our cabin and it&#8217;s typical when we&#8217;re exiting the front door for them to scamper half way up a tree and then stop to stare at us with dark, unblinking eyes and a wary posture that says —<em> I can run up this trunk faster than you&#8230; but I won&#8217;t, unless I have to</em>. The look of this particular one just made me want to bust out laughing! That hairline on its head where a new coat of fur is growing in conjures up images of TV sitcom stars from my youth. At first I thought of Squiggy from &#8220;Laverne &amp; Shirley&#8221;, but then I decided that Eddie Munster was probably a closer match. HA HA! </p>

											<p><a title="rattlesnake digesting meal" href="/assets/content/20110509/blog_lg-20110509-5670.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110509/blog-20110509-5670.jpg" alt="rattlesnake digesting meal" width="680" height="340"></a><span class="caption">Southern Pacific Rattlesnake <em><em>(Crotalus oreganus helleri)</em></em></span><strong><strong><em><strong><strong><em><br></em></strong></strong></em></strong></strong>This past Friday afternoon, we were leaving the house to run a few errands. I scanned the steps before walking down them (as I have learned to do) and quickly spotted this immature rattlesnake. It was on the small size at about a foot long, though I have certainly seen them smaller. It was perfectly still and — despite being relatively out in the open — its cryptic coloration made it difficult to pick out from the background. After grabbing a long stick that I keep on the porch (for just such reasons), I carefully walked past it, making sure to lead with the stick. I have NEVER had a rattlesnake try to bite me or be in any way aggressive, but if I have to get this close to them and for some reason the snake were to feel threatened, I think it&#8217;s smart to give them something to strike at (other than my foot). As is often the case, this snake didn&#8217;t seem the least bit concerned by me, and once I was a few feet passed it, I stopped to have a good look and take some pictures. The first thing I noticed was the obvious bulge in its abdomen. According to my favorite website, <a href="http://www.californiaherps.com/" target="_blank">California Herps</a>, Southern Pacific Rattlesnake eat &#8220;birds, lizards, snakes, frogs, insects, and small mammals, including  mice, rats, rabbits,  hares, and ground squirrels&#8221;. Knowing what&#8217;s readily available around our porch and the size of the snake, I would not be at all surprised if its last victim had been a fence lizard (a Great Basin Fence Lizard,<em><em> Sceloporus occidentalis longipes</em></em>, to be exact). That&#8217;s just speculation, of course, we also have good-sized populations of several of the other prey animals on that list. A mouse would be entirely plausible too.) I had never observed a snake in the process of digesting a meal before and I was tickled to be able to get a few photos. Fortunately, when we returned home an hour or so later, this little one had moved on to a less trafficked area. </p>
<p>Just for fun, I thought I&#8217;d include this image I took before I headed down the steps. Can you see the snake? If you can&#8217;t, click on the image to see a highlighted version&#8230; Oh, but it would be so much easier if they were neon yellow! (*chuckle*) Well, easier for me! Undoubtedly much harder on the snake, who makes its way in the world by being difficult for both predators and prey to see. </p>

<p>I had been such an avid reader for so many years of various excellent blogs that I had a pretty high standard of what I wanted to accomplish when I set out to begin my own. I definitely wanted a place to showcase my photography, artwork and poetry. I wanted to write about my observations and discoveries, to educate and enlighten people about my biggest passion — wildlife. I aimed to inspire readers, to entertain them, and to (hopefully) keep them coming back for more. Yet, if I&#8217;m being honest, more than anything else I was looking for an opportunity to share my life with more people. I spend a lot of time alone; partially by choice. I love the solitary hours I spend out in the field. Just me and the animals, the plants, the earth and sky. When I&#8217;m around other humans, I tend to be a bit frenetic and sometimes I have a hard time feeling comfortable in my own skin. But alone&#8230; outside&#8230; I am truly a different person. Life slows for me. I focus deeply. I breathe easier. I feel completely at home and content. I like who I am.</p>
<p>I suppose I thought that maybe I could merge those two worlds&#8230; the one where I&#8217;m alone (but the kind of person I&#8217;d like to be) and the one where I can interact with other people (but don&#8217;t always express myself as I&#8217;d like to). This blog seemed like a perfect opportunity to try to bridge the gap. It started out well enough&#8230; Nine posts in my first month! Then, there was only one in March — but I told myself it was because we&#8217;d been on vacation and I was just getting a slow start, easing back into the groove of things. But, here it is the first week of May, and it is hard not to see the writing on the wall as I acknowledge that I barely managed to <strong>eek*</strong> out a single post for April too. I have heaps of beautiful photos still to share of our <a href="/from-los-angeles-to-seattle-day-1" target="_blank">exciting trip to Vashon</a>. There has been non-stop Spring activity here in the canyon and every day seems to bring a new story to tell. My camera has been full of images and my head full of thoughts. So, what went wrong? </p>
<p>Well&#8230; I fell victim to my familiar weakness — perfectionism.</p>
<p>All my life I have struggled with my own unrealistically high standards. I have a vision in my mind of what I want to accomplish and sometimes I stubbornly refuse to settle for anything short of that. The upside is that when I actually do manage to complete something, I&#8217;d like to think that the end product is high-quality. The downside (and it&#8217;s a BIG one) is that I struggle over things that should be enjoyable and I often give-up on them entirely rather than settle for something &#8220;less than&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a trait that I like in myself and it&#8217;s one I&#8217;d like to change, if I can.</p>
<p><strong>From this day forward, I&#8217;ve promised myself that I will post something every day.</strong> Sometimes, it may only be a single photo and a few words&#8230; still, it will be <em>something</em>. (I considered making this deal quietly to myself instead of broadcasting it, but old habits die hard and I feared I would backslide without some accountability.) I feel quite certain that it is more important for me to use this blog to share regularly about myself and the things that bring me joy than it is to have every entry be perfect. I&#8217;ve connected with so many warm-hearted, like-minded people via the Internet. They have brought so much camaraderie and contentment into my life. I&#8217;m happy and excited at the prospect of just focusing on making that connection and no longer getting as bogged down by limitations and standards that only exist in my own head. </p>
<p>So&#8230; I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow to share something wonderful&#8230; and the day after that&#8230; and the day after that&#8230; and the day after that&#8230; *grin*</p>
<p><strong>[* EDIT: My husband just informed me that apparently the correct spelling is &#8220;eke&#8221;. Huh&#8230; you learn something new everyday! It seems cosmically fitting that there should be at least one typo in my post on abandoing perfectionism, doesn&#8217;t it?!]</strong></p>
