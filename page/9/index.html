                        is native to many parts of the southern United States,
                        but here in California it is an introduced species.

                      in Long Beach. We saw so many fantastic birds, arthropods
                      and other critters! I had a really great time&#8230;
                      though after a couple hours of walking around, I had to
                      concede that I was a tad jealous of how completely
                      r-e-l-a-x-e-d some of the turtles looked. *GRIN*

                      is a real favorite of mine and a lizard species that I
                      never really got to see regularly until we moved to the
                      canyon. They prefer hot and arid habitat with relatively
                      sparse vegetation, which describes much of the habitat
                      around here. These guys are proficient diggers when
                      foraging for invertebrate prey and they are super speedy
                      when they want to be. (There&#8217;s a cool video about

                      on California Herps.com if you want to get some idea of
                      how fast they are.) Definitely not an easy lizard to
                      catch, but I have found that with a slow and steady
                      approach it is possible to observe them closely. Usually I
                      start seeing them towards the end of May and then
                      continuing through September or October. (Note: This may
                      not be indicative of their actual seasonal activity,
                      it&#8217;s just what I have noticed from my daily
                      sightings over the last several years.)

                      I love this photo of a pair I was hanging out with one
                      July afternoon a few years ago. They took a break from
                      their courtship activities to rest awhile in the shade.
                      Here you can see how wonderfully camouflaged they are:

                      The juvenile lizards are much more colorful than the

                      So, aside from wanting to share this great reptile with
                      you all, I guess I&#8217;m kind of hoping this post will
                      serve as a conjuring trick of sorts. You see, I
                      haven&#8217;t actually seen one since last year and I
                      haven&#8217;t had the chance to photograph one since May
                      of 2009. I&#8217;m fairly certain this lizard&#8217;s
                      population is relatively stable in this area, so I&#8217;m
                      not worried that they&#8217;re not out there&#8230;
                      it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;d love the opportunity to
                      spend some more time in the field with them.

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      A few days ago, a friend sent me a wonderful link to some
                      footage of jellyfish in
                      <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palau"
                        target="_blank"
                        >Palau</a
                      >
                      and I started thinking about how amazing it would be to
                      actually get to see these creatures for myself. Oh, I mean
                      I&#8217;ve <em>seen</em> lots of jellyfish&#8230; in
                      aquariums, in countless nature films, but never in person.
                      Eventually, as is often the case with unknown places and
                      things, I began to wonder what it would be like to
                      photograph them. Who knows, perhaps someday I will get the
                      opportunity and have those incredible photos to share with
                      you all! For now, I thought I&#8217;d showcase one of my
                      favorite images and a very special memory of mine&#8230;
                      Last year, near the end of October, I was photographing
                      this intriguing series of wispy clouds (<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_cloud"
                        target="_blank"
                        >cirrus clouds</a
                      >, I believe). As I stood gazing upwards, a subtle rainbow
                      appeared. This was not a rainbow arcing across the sky,
                      this was a rainbow in the cloud itself. I quickly snapped
                      several shots and I&#8217;m glad that I didn&#8217;t
                      hesitate because it only lasted about 2 seconds.
                      <em>(Really! I checked the time stamp on my photos!) </em
                      >After it disappeared, I mused to myself that it was a
                      lucky thing I had been already engaged in the activity of
                      photographing that particular cloud, or I&#8217;m certain
                      I would have missed out on capturing it, and possibly
                      never seen it at all.

                    <p>
                      So, according to the reading I&#8217;ve done, the
                      (entirely unromantic) scientific term for this phenomenon
                      is &#8220;<a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumhorizontal_arc"
                        target="_blank"
                        >circumhorizontal arc</a
                      >&#8220;. I have also seen it referred to as a
                      &#8220;cloudbow&#8221; and I understand that it is a
                      fairly common occurrence caused by the relatively high
                      angle of the sun as it strikes ice crystals in the cloud.
                      But for me, the instant association I had on that day, the
                      very reason I was photographing the cloud in the first
                      place&#8230;. was that it looked like a jellyfish. When
                      the rainbow suffused the hanging tentacles, the illusion
                      seemed complete to me. There, in the infinitely blue
                      expanse of ocean-sky, hung a bioluminescent creature of
                      the deep. Fanciful, I know&#8230; but, that&#8217;s what I
                      saw. And once seen, it&#8217;s now impossible for me to
                      unsee it. <em>Why would I want to anyway?</em>

                      Another night of unsatisfying sleep, my Inbox is full of
                      e-mail awaiting responses, my household chores are
                      steadily backing up. In light of all of this, I had
                      decided that I would stay inside today and just post some
                      remaining photos from yesterday&#8217;s walk. But&#8230;
                      this morning I looked outside and it was cloudy. I cracked
                      the front door and the weather was cool and breezy. Birds
                      were singing&#8230; squirrels were zipping around&#8230;
                      and, well, you know how it goes. I got dressed and put my
                      shoes on. [insert sheepish grin] I figured I should at
                      least grab a cup of juice before leaving and while gulping
                      it down, I peered out the kitchen window. As if on cue, my
                      favorite spotted-little-one showed up with its mom and
                      gave me a glimpse or two as it snuck through the sage and
                      olive trees.

                      There was a fair bit of blue sky showing, but the clouds
                      that covered the rest of the sky more than made up for it.
                      Wispy and whimsical. Puffs and arcs. Stretching, shifting
                      and moving. Aaaah&#8230; action in the sky&#8230; just
                      what I crave!

                      this most wonderful pattern:

                      A Cooper&#8217;s Hawk (quite likely

                        >the same one from yesterday</a
                      >!) soared effortlessly above me. Sharing the sky with the
                      hawk were a few swallows swooping and diving at unseen
                      insects. I heard the raucous croaking of the boisterous
                      raven family long before I spotted them high over the
                      hills. The juveniles are as big as the adults now and the
                      family (6 birds total, I think) loudly travels together in
                      search of food and perhaps a bit of mayhem.

                      There were small arthropod joys to be had as well. Several
                      bumble bees were working a patch of California Poppies. If
                      <a href="/the-miracle-of-letting-go" target="_blank"
                        >yesterday&#8217;s photos</a
                      >
                      were a matter of good luck and perfect timing,
                      today&#8217;s images proved to be more a matter of supreme
                      patience and diligence. For some reason, my camera
                      repeatedly refused to achieve focus when I wanted it to,
                      and countless opportunities for beautiful shots of the
                      bees ended up as little more than blurry blobs of orange,
                      yellow and black. But, it was a beautiful day to be out
                      and I smiled despite my frustration, and stuck with it
                      until I managed to come away with at least a few nifty
                      shots.

                      I knew I had been gone too long, and reluctantly I turned
                      and headed for home. As I rounded the corner of the small
                      work shed near our cabin, I slowed down to carefully watch
                      my step and scan the ground&#8230; Why? Well, because
                      there&#8217;s always the chance I&#8217;ll see
                      <em>this </em>poking out of the abandoned ground squirrel

                    <p>
                      I haven&#8217;t been feeling very well the last several
                      days. The biggest bummer is that I&#8217;m having a lot of
                      trouble sleeping. My fatigue just seems to make everything
                      I try to accomplish so much harder. Like swimming in
                      molasses. To compound the problem, my mood has been pretty
                      contrary as well. I don&#8217;t know if anyone else can
                      relate to this&#8230; but there are certain things that
                      never fail to improve my state-of-mind, yet sometimes I
                      stupidly avoid doing them. I&#8217;m really not sure
                      why&#8230; I suppose it&#8217;s the adult equivalent of
                      having a bit of a tantrum. Things aren&#8217;t going my
                      way, so I temporarily just stubbornly refuse to let anyone
                      or anything make it better. So, anyway, I&#8217;ve been
                      struggling with this and when it came time to do my blog
                      post today, I just didn&#8217;t want to do it. I
                      wasn&#8217;t coming up with any good ideas and the whole
                      process was starting to feel really excruciating. Finally,
                      I decided to give in. I did the one thing that never fails
                      to clear my head and put things in perspective. I put on
                      my shoes and went outside, determined that I would just do
                      what I always do — look for something beautiful or
                      extraordinary and photograph it. Then, when I came back
                      home, I would simply post whatever I found and not think
                      too much more about it.
                    </p>

                      I couldn&#8217;t have walked more than about 5 minutes
                      from my house when I stopped to listen to the birds,
                      absorbing the sounds that I love so well. California Quail
                      whooping and popping in the bushes. Phainopepla doing a
                      perfect impersonation of water slowly dripping from a
                      faucet. The happy twittering of a small flock of Bushtit
                      trickling through the underbrush. Something caught my eye
                      in the tangle of young olive trees ahead and I
                      instinctively lifted my camera. I had just enough time to
                      process the shape of an immature Cooper&#8217;s Hawk,
                      looking a bit startled at being discovered. I wasn&#8217;t
                      even sure if I had the bird framed in the viewfinder, but
                      I knew it was &#8220;now or never&#8221; and I pressed the
                      shutter just before the hawk sailed over my head. I took
                      only one shot and this was it:

                      I relaxed, knowing that I had at least one wonderful image
                      to share when I got home. I eased into the feeling of just
                      being outdoors. I took a deep breath and felt more and
                      more of my funky mood slipping away. I spied a Mourning
                      Dove perched high in the spindly branches at the top of a
                      eucalyptus. The bird and branch swayed side-to-side in the
                      strong canyon breeze. The trunk creaked like an old boat
                      in the wind, and the mass of leaves below the bird
                      quivered and rippled like big green waves. I decided to
                      test if lightning would strike twice and I framed the bird
                      in the lens and waited patiently to see if I could catch a
                      flight image. The dove stayed stoically still, eyeballing
                      me and cocking its head, but not budging. Then, I saw a
                      flicker of movement and reflexively pressed the shutter.
                      Miraculously, I captured this wonderful hummer who zipped
                      in for a split second to investigate the dove and then was
                      gone!

                      A smile couldn&#8217;t help but spread across my face and
                      I grinned foolishly up at the dove. Let&#8217;s try this
                      one more time, I said. The dove made me wait awhile before
                      finally flapping noisily over to another branch a few feet
                      away — but I got the shot! Not only that, but I got a
                      second one when it finally had enough of me and flew off
                      that perch as well.

                      I&#8217;m still exhausted (more now than before I went
                      out) and I&#8217;m yawning as I write this. But, I&#8217;m
                      feeling peaceful and content inside. Tantrum over. Lesson
                      learned. When nothing seems to be working and everything
                      feels harder than it should — go outside, let go, and
                      enjoy what comes!

                      I hope everyone had a relaxing long weekend&#8230; and
                      perhaps managed to discover a bit of the joy and
                      fufillment that is always present in nature, just waiting
                      to be savored.

                      First off, my apologies to The Beatles for usurping the
                      title of their song for my nerdy, semi-humorous, botanical
                      purposes. *GRIN* This is a photo I took yesterday of a

                      I discovered them nestled deep inside the center of a

                      is also referenced as <em>Mimulus aurantiacus,</em> and is
                      known commonly as Orange Bush Monkey Flower or Sticky

                      This is a very common and prolific flower here in the
                      canyon. As it is extremely drought-resistant, it easily
                      covers the hillsides in a bright, orange perfusion of
                      blossoms and continues to bloom long after most of the
                      other Spring wildflowers have peaked.

                    <p>
                      Around the same time as
                      <a href="/first-fawn" target="_blank">yesterday</a>, in
                      just about the same place&#8230; guess who I spotted
                      again?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Hah&#8230; &#8220;spotted again&#8221;&#8230; that&#8217;s
                      funny! This little one certainly is spotted and terribly
                      cute.

                      This time, I managed to get to my camera in time to grab a
                      few shots. The resolution is not fantastic because I had
                      to shoot at a pretty steep angle through the glass of our
                      kitchen window, which always causes some unfortunate
                      distortion. But, these images are all about capturing and
                      preserving my memories of this lovely creature. Mission
                      accomplished!

                    <p>
                      This morning, I had the blinds in my bedroom open while I
                      was working away at my computer. I registered a bit of
                      movement and looked up in time to see a bunch of spots,
                      two pair of wobbly legs, big ears and dark eyes staring
                      back at me. This is the first Mule Deer
                      <em>(Odocoileus hemionus)</em> fawn I&#8217;ve seen this
                      season and it made my heart smile!! I wasn&#8217;t fast
                      enough getting to my camera to snap any pics before the
                      skiddish youngster trotted out of view, but here&#8217;s
                      an honorary pic from the archives to celebrate the
                      occasion.
                      <em
                        >(I love the expression of the foreground fawn in this
                        photo and the whimsical out-of-focus background that the
                        tail-end of its twin sibling provides.)
                      </em>

                    <p>
