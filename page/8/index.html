<p>As I was driving home a few days ago, I saw a small group of <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/band-tailed_pigeon/id" target="_blank">Band-tailed Pigeon<em> (Columba fasciata)</em></a> flying by and a couple landed on the wires paralleling the road. These are some good-sized birds and I stopped the truck to sit and watch their impossible teetering — tipping wildly back and forth, but somehow managing to stay upright. I did a balancing act of my own and leaned waaaaay out the car window to take some backlit images of these two. The trick was trying to time the shots for the few seconds when its namesake tail would be illuminated by the Sun&#8217;s rays.</p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/whiptail-wishes-granted/">Whiptail Wishes Granted!</a></h3>					
											<p>As you may recall, <a href="/wishing-for-whiptail" target="_blank">last week I was wondering</a> where all of the <a href="http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/a.t.stejnegeri.html" target="_blank">Coastal Whiptail <em>(Aspidoscelis tigris stejnegeri)</em></a> were and hoping that my blog post might serve as a lizard &#8220;rain dance&#8221; of sorts and bring some my way. Well, I still haven&#8217;t seen any here in the canyon, but I did get my wish&#8230;</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Coastal Whiptail, on the move" href="/assets/content/20110613/blog_lg-20110613-9479.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110613/blog-20110613-9479.jpg" alt="Coastal Whiptail, on the move" width="680" height="255"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I had the pleasure of accompanying some of my out-of-town relatives on an afternoon walk at the <a href="http://www.rsabg.org/" target="_blank">Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden</a> today. This lovely botanical garden is entirely focused on the native plants of California and is a wonderful destination for any nature lover. We actually saw several (at least 3 or 4) whiptail, which is far more than I can ever recall seeing at the garden before. Mostly we saw them scurrying off the side of the main path, busily foraging in the leaf litter. But, the spectacular lizard pictured here was coming right down the path towards us. Everyone stopped and stood very still — <em>possibly due to my bossy instructions for everyone to stay put and please let me try and get a few photos before it hurried off</em>. Apparently I needn&#8217;t have worried, because as if on cue, the lizard stopped directly in front of us and then pressed its belly down on the warm earth and calmly rested for a minute or so. More than enough time for us all to get a good look and for me to get a few nice images!</p>
<p> </p>

According to <a href="http://www.californiaherps.com/lizards/pages/a.t.stejnegeri.html" target="_blank">CaliforniaHerps.com</a>, eggs are typically laid between the months of April and August, so it&#8217;s certainly within the realm of possibility.</span></p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/eucalyptus-izing/">Eucalyptus-izing</a></h3>					
											<p>It&#8217;s nearing the end of a very long day&#8230; About an hour ago, I said good-bye to my husband as he departed for a week-long business trip to Australia. Sadly, he probably won&#8217;t get to see much more than whatever is visible from his hotel, but I still hope he manages to have a bit of an adventure and see a few cool sights during his travels. </p>
<p>On my drive home, I found myself thinking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eucalyptus" target="_blank">Eucalyptus</a> — a genus of tree that grows prolifically in Australia where it is a native. In southern California, these trees are planted so frequently and have thrived here for so many years that it&#8217;s hard for me to not consider them a permanent part of the landscape. And yet&#8230; there was a time when not a trace of Eucalyptus would have been found on this continent. Odd to think about. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Eucalyptus leaf" href="/assets/content/20110611/blog_lg-20110611-2997.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110611/blog-20110611-2997.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus leaf" width="680" height="340"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This leaf could have been photographed anywhere. </p>
<p>In truth, it was just one of the many in the canyon that decorate the ground along the trails behind my house&#8230; but, it <em>could</em> have been Australia. How would you know the difference? A leaf is a leaf is a leaf.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="Black Bear claw marks on Eucalyptus" href="/assets/content/20110611/blog_lg-20110611-6229.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110611/blog-20110611-6229.jpg" alt="Black Bear claw marks on Eucalytpus" width="680" height="340"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a photo that could never be taken in Australia. </p>
<p>The multicolored trunk and peeling layers of bark wouldn&#8217;t be much of a stretch, but this particular Eucalyptus stands near our cabin and it is beautifully etched with the claw marks of one of the resident <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Black_Bear" target="_blank">Black Bear <em>(Ursus americanus)</em></a>. Despite the misleading name often attributed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koala" target="_blank">Koala</a>, there are no bears in Australia.</p>
<p> Around here, the bears appear to regularly climb and mark the Eucalyptus trees. From the evidence I&#8217;ve seen, I gather that at least some of the time they are searching for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_honey_bee" target="_blank">Honey Bee <em>(Apis mellifera)</em></a> nests to ransack. A bee species which, by the way, originates from Europe, Asia and Africa. </p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; always so interesting to ponder the increasing convergence of introduced and native wildlife here in California.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn&#8217;t really going anywhere with all of this&#8230; Sorry! Just musing to myself and trying to share a little something with y&#8217;all before I crash for the night. <em><strong>Wishing everyone an enjoyable weekend and hoping that nature figures in your plans somewhere!</strong></em></p>
<p>[EDIT: After doing a bit more reading, I thought I should probably clarify that while they may all be casually referred to as &#8220;eucalyptus&#8221;, there are actually three potential genera — <em>Eucalyptus,</em><em><em> Angophora</em></em> and <em><em>Corymbia — </em></em>that make up this group of plants. I haven&#8217;t attempted to identify the various species of eucalyptus around my place&#8230;. yet! Perhaps that will be the subject of a future blog post.]</p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/detail-oriented/">Detail-oriented</a></h3>					
											<p>I don&#8217;t think there has ever been a time in my existence when I wasn&#8217;t fascinated by the small details of life. My mother has told me stories of how ridiculously long it took to walk anywhere with me when I was a toddler as I kept stopping every few feet or so to inspect something that had caught my interest. For anyone who&#8217;s ever had the experience of walking somewhere with me today, they can probably attest that not a lot has changed! *GRIN* </p>
<p>Though it can be distracting (and occasionally overwhelming), my heightened attention to very small details is not a trait I would ever really want to change. I think it is an essential component of being a good naturalist&#8230; and photographer too. Being able to see small differences in two different shots can be very useful when editing a large number of images. Paying attention to how an image makes you feel if you alter the exposure a little or experiment with a slightly different crop can really improve your finished product. Of course, sometimes I wonder if the things I get hung-up on are perhaps <em>too subtle</em> for most people to care about. For instance, I was working on this image today:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="sky &amp; water pre-crop" href="/assets/content/20110610/blog_lg-20110610-9421.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110610/blog-20110610-9421.jpg" alt="sky &amp; water pre-crop" width="680" height="510"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This gorgeous scene was captured from the window of the train on the return leg of our <a href="/from-los-angeles-to-seattle-day-1" target="_blank">trip to Seattle</a>. The body of water paralleling the tracks provided a perfect mirror image of the striated sky above. The colors were subtle and perfect. This is the image I took, full-frame, nothing done in post-processing except to adjust the exposure a bit. I wanted this to feel somewhat abstract. I wanted it to be more about the repeating colors and lines than about the context of the scenery per se. As I stared at the above image, something just wasn&#8217;t sitting right for me. So, I cropped it, like this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="sky &amp; water cropped" href="/assets/content/20110610/blog_lg-20110610-9421a.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110610/blog-20110610-9421a.jpg" alt="sky &amp; water cropped" width="680" height="544"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you can immediately tell the difference between these two shots&#8230; well then, I am impressed! This crop did serve some practical purpose because my camera creates images that are roughly 8 x 10.6 inches. These dimensions are not particularly useful for making prints and cropping this to a standard size of 8 x 10 inches makes sense. But, that&#8217;s not why I did it. My reasons were far less obvious&#8230;</p>
<p>I am always trying to understand how someone&#8217;s eye reads a photo or piece of artwork. I think there are ways to guide the eye. To subtly suggest where the focus should be and how the eye travels to get there. My goal with this piece was to have the viewer&#8217;s eye follow the repeating horizontal lines in a way that would feel seamless&#8230; flowing, I suppose. Back and forth, like a typewriter, spewing pastel lines of clouds and water. I wanted to include the land below the water because it anchored the whole scene a bit and gave a hint of context. But foreground — especially darker foreground — is always going to draw the eye, and in this case, my attention kept being inexorably drawn to that tiny dark blob in the lower left corner. A little bump that made me stop and scrutinize when I wanted to just keep gliding back and forth. </p>
<p>At this point — if you&#8217;re still reading — you&#8217;re probably thinking 1) this woman is more than a little neurotic, and 2) does it really make any appreciable difference? Well, I freely admit to the first point&#8230; and as to the second, who knows? I felt instantly better about the whole thing after cropping it, but I have no idea how it translates to others. I&#8217;d be happy to hear what you think! Here are the two images side-by-side:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="sky &amp; water compare" href="/assets/content/20110610/blog_lg-20110610-9421_9421a.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110610/blog-20110610-9421_9421a.jpg" alt="sky &amp; water compare" width="666" height="248"></a><span class="caption">*Click on this (and the above images) if you want to see a larger view.*</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Eventually, after staring at these two images for long enough and putting this blog post together, I began to second-guess myself. <em>What was the big deal with the little blob anyway??? </em>It finally dawned on me that it was the &#8220;blob&#8221; part that wasn&#8217;t working for me. Though a small protrusion, it poked up out of an otherwise congruous series of lines and drew attention. But then, to further frustrate things, I simply couldn&#8217;t resolve <em>what</em> I was looking at and that made my eye linger even longer on this spot. At this point, curiosity got the better of me and I enlarged the image and seriously increased the exposure to get a better view of the inscrutable dark lump. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110610/blog-20110610-9421b.jpg" alt="sky &amp; water blob revealed" width="261" height="261"></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Surprise! It&#8217;s a GOOSE!!! A Canada Goose, with its back to the camera, to be exact. Hah! Now, <em>if</em> this goose had been more visible, recognizable as a goose from a distance, there is no way that I ever would&#8217;ve considered cropping it out. That would have been a perfect destination for the viewer&#8217;s eye — traveling across the image and settling on this lone bird also surveying the unfolding scenery. Ahhh, but it wasn&#8217;t meant to be this time around, I guess. </p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230; re-reading this post, it seems awfully long and meandering. Not sure if anything I&#8217;ve written will be of interest to anyone. Just trying to give some insight into my creative process, which at times can perhaps be overly rigorous. More and more, I recognize that I must give myself more freedom to have fun and be spontaneous with my photography&#8230; but, <strong><em>the details do matter to me</em></strong> and they probably always will. And&#8230; I&#8217;m OK with that!</p>

											<p>Last weekend, in addition to all my fun with <a href="/relaxin-weekend" target="_blank">turtles</a> and <a href="/green-heron-blue-damsels" target="_blank">Green Heron</a>, I also had the pleasure of attending <a href="http://www.gallerydarrow.net/2011/06/weekend-update.html" target="_blank">my friends&#8217; annual ceramic/jewelry sale</a> at their home. Although it was easy to be entranced by so much amazing artistry in one place, I still found myself occasionally sidetracked by the critters. You see, they have a simply wonderful garden (featuring many native plants) and the birds, insects, lizards and small mammals surely must be eternally grateful to them for such splendid habitat. I told myself I wasn&#8217;t going to walk around taking pics the whole time, but when I saw this little green jewel&#8230; well, how could one realistically resist?!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="sweat bee &amp; sunflower" href="/assets/content/20110609/blog_lg-20110609-8712.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110609/blog-20110609-8712.jpg" alt="sweat bee &amp; sunflower" width="600" height="600"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When I showed her my photos, Ro told me that she had been seeing the same bee on that sunflower earlier. She asked what kind of bee it was, but my response at the time was a bit vague&#8230; Probably something like this:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s in the <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/128" target="_blank">family Halictidae</a>. A group of bees that are commonly known as &#8216;Sweat Bees&#8217;. (Yeah, I know, not the most romantic of names!) There are two different kinds that I think it could be, but I forget how to pronounce their names — they both sound like Greek gods to me&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><a title="sweat bee &amp; sunflower" href="/assets/content/20110609/blog_lg-20110609-8714.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110609/blog-20110609-8714.jpg" alt="sweat bee &amp; sunflower" width="680" height="255"></a><br></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In my defense, many insects don&#8217;t have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_name" target="_blank"><em>common names</em></a> assigned to them, just long, hard to pronounce <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_name" target="_blank">scientific names</a>. </em>A lot of them also look very, very similar and I confess that in the end I needed <a href="http://bugguide.net/user/view/8607" target="_blank">one of the insanely good experts on BugGuide</a> to help me out. With his assistance, I can now confidently say:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Behold! <strong><a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/7997" target="_blank">Agapostemon</a>!</strong></em><em> All-powerful green god of the sunflower children. Dazzling beyond measure, with skin that sparkles like a million emeralds and furry chaps dripping with gold dust&#8221; </em></p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><em>*GRIN*</em></p>
<p>I guess I&#8217;m feeling a bit silly today&#8230; </p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="sweat bee &amp; sunflower" href="/assets/content/20110609/blog_lg-20110609-8716.jpg" target="_blank"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110609/blog-20110609-8716.jpg" alt="sweat bee &amp; sunflower" width="680" height="255"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There are so many species of native bees (as opposed to the introduced, non-native <a href="http://bugguide.net/node/view/3080" target="_blank">Honey Bee, <em>Apis mellifera</em></a>) and they come in all shapes, sizes and colors. Next time you see one&#8230; approach slowly and take a good close look&#8230; they&#8217;re beautiful creatures! <em>(Oh, and if you happen to take a picture&#8230; send it to me! I love getting the opportunity to try to identify mystery insects.)</em></p>

											<p><a title="Green Heron pano" href="/assets/content/20110607/blog_lg-20110607-9007.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110607/blog-20110607-9007.jpg" alt="Green Heron pano"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For anyone not familiar, the <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/green_heron/id" target="_blank">Green Heron <em>(Butorides virescens)</em></a> is a small (16 – 18 inches) wading bird that can be found throughout much of the U.S. along creeks and rivers or at ponds, lakes, marshes, swamps and even pastures. Finding the immature bird in the above photo probably isn&#8217;t too hard&#8230; but at a distance they are extremely cryptic and even up close they can be hard to spot if they&#8217;re standing still.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a title="photographer &amp; hidden Green Heron" href="/assets/content/20110607/blog_lg-20110607-9002.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" class="center" src="/assets/content/20110607/blog-20110607-9002.jpg" alt="photographer &amp; hidden Green Heron"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Now, why would I include this photo? </em> Well, because I thought it was amusing. This woman was diligently taking photos of a turtle sunning on the edge of the pond in front of her. Unseen from her vantage point was the stealthy heron lurking in the foreground several feet away. <em>Can&#8217;t see it? <strong>*Click on the image if you&#8217;re in need of some assistance.*</strong></em></p>
<p>Of course the heron has good reason to skulk quietly and slowly in the partial shadows at the water&#8217;s edge&#8230; Much of its diet is comprised of small fish. Actually, it is one of the few bird species known to use bait in order to capture its fish prey. According to <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/green_heron/lifehistory" target="_blank">the Cornell Lab of Ornithology&#8217;s website</a>: <em>&#8220;It commonly drops bait onto the surface of the water and grabs the small fish that are attracted. It uses a variety of baits and lures, including crusts of bread, insects, earthworms, twigs, or feathers.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>The Green Heron is also known to eat frogs, insects and other invertebrates. While <a href="/relaxin-weekend" target="_blank">hanging out at El Dorado Regional Park</a> last weekend, it was my extreme pleasure to get to watch one immature heron hunting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damselflies" target="_blank">damselflies</a>. The vegetation around the ponds was rife with bright blue and pinkish damselflies. Rarely can I recall seeing so many damsels in one location. Time after time we watched this bird snap at the air and at plant edges. From what we observed, it had a pretty high rate of success, catching damsel after damsel and gulping them down. The fact that I caught a few of these captures on film was just marvelous! <em>*Be sure to click on the images to see more detail.*</em></p>

<p>All of these photos were taken during our <a href="/relaxin-weekend" target="_blank">day trip to El Dorado Regional Park</a> where we were quite entertained by our observations of one (or possibly two) of these immature heron. I leave you with this parting image&#8230; </p>

					<h3 class="teaser-post-title"><a href="/quailets/">Quailets</a></h3>					
											<p>As we were driving out of the canyon on Sunday — on our way to <a href="/relaxin-weekend" target="_blank">our destination in Long Beach</a> — we arrived at a flat area of open fields and low brush (same spot as in <a href="/good-morning-nope-great-morning" target="_blank">this post</a>) where we have observed several quail couples regularly foraging for the last few months. It&#8217;s been my experience that in the late Summer, Fall, and Winter months, <a href="http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/California_Quail/id" target="_blank">California Quail <em>(Callipepla californica)</em></a> travel in typically large groups (known as coveys), but beginning in early Spring, they start pairing off and the couples seem quite inseparable from that point on. As we slowed to allow one such pair to cross the road, I was delighted to see four little chicks scurrying between their legs! These are the first babies I&#8217;ve seen this season, and though I had to take these so-so pictures through the front windshield, the results are still undeniably cute! (Click on any image for a slightly embiggened view.)</p>
