              <p>
                I sat down today to work on prepping those Mule Deer images I
                promised. Several young males (last year&#8217;s fawns) have
                been hanging about lately. Adult females and their spotted
                little ones share their company as they make daily visits around
                the perimeter of the cabin. They stop to get a drink of water,
                nibble on the plants and bushes, and to lay in the cool, shady
                areas. In photographing them, I managed to capture some
                wonderful expressions and behavior. However, as is often the
                case (especially if I attempt to shoot through the kitchen
                window), I found myself unhappy with the quality of the photos.
                It&#8217;s not that they&#8217;re horrible, they simply suffer
                from various problems like soft focus, contrasty lighting,
                improper exposure or unwanted objects. Using a graphics program
                like Photoshop, there are countless ways to attempt to improve
                or fix these issues. Some times I go that route&#8230; But,
                other times, I find that if an image needs a significant amount
                of manipulation it&#8217;s just more fun to unleash my
                creativity instead of trying to make it look like the perfect
                photograph I had imagined. By playing with the digital filters
                and brushes, altering the color palette or lighting, it&#8217;s
                possible to create a myriad of artistic effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                I thought it might be interesting to start by showing you this
                image exactly as it looked after I downloaded it from my camera:
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  fetchpriority="high"
                  decoding="async"
                  class="center"
                  src="/assets/content/20110801/blog-20110801-2245b.jpg"
                  alt="Mule Deer, male eating Toyon"
                  width="680"
                  height="510"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                This young male was so blissfully chewing away on the Toyon
                leaves, that he hardly seemed to notice me standing at the
                window taking photos. It was a beautiful few moments. But, the
                image looked so washed out and lifeless to me. I wanted to try
                and add more of the warmth and intimacy that I had felt. Also,
                the background was very bright and eye-catching, so I hoped to
                even out the light some, make it twinkle a bit, and highlight
                all the wonderful leaves.

                    width="486"
                    height="486"
                /></a>
              </p>
              <p>
                I liked the way the deer fills this square crop and the
                painterly effect is very close to what I had envisioned. (If
                anyone is interested, I used the &#8220;Accented Edges&#8221;
                filter and then experimented with the color and exposure.)
              </p>
              <p>
                I know it can be very hard to get a feel for the subtleties of
                the texture and brush strokes with the small size of web
                presentation. I usually do provide a larger version that can be
                seen my clicking on the image, but it is still a very limited
                view. So, here is a crop showing just a portion of the above
                image so that you can see more detail.
              </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>
                In this next instance, you can see an example of an original
                image which is really not very good. But, I so loved the
                composition and the delightful scene it portrayed that I wanted
                to try and do something nice with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img
                  loading="lazy"

                  src="/assets/content/20110801/blog-20110801-2340a.jpg"
                  alt="Mule Deer, two males resting"

                  height="510"
                />
              </p>
              <p>
                These two young males decided to lay down near each other in
                late afternoon shade. They were just within view through my
                kitchen window and they weren&#8217;t going anywhere, but no
                matter how many photos I took, the glass distortion and lighting
                conspired to leave me with less than satisfactory shots.
                Additionally, there was that exposed (defunct) pipe jutting out
                off the ground next to the upper deer in every single image. It
                was the layered appearance of the background and the repeating
                shapes of the deer that had compelled me to take the photo in
                the first place, so I tried to focus on those elements when
                cropping and transforming it. (In this case, the filtering
                process also makes it very easy to seamlessly clone a portion of
                the background to obscure the unattractive pipe.)

                Though I don&#8217;t always succeed, it is always my goal to
                accomplish something that is <em>better</em> than the original
                photo. To create something that tugs at the essence of what I
                saw when I first lifted my camera, but then draws it out
                further&#8230; Exaggerating it to evoke an emotion or feeling
                that might otherwise have gone unnoticed.

                  I especially like the graphic feeling of the last image, it
                  would make a nice greeting card. Nice views right out the

                  Hiya, Ro! Yeah&#8230; When we first checked out this cabin,
                  I&#8217;m pretty sure that as soon as I saw the view out the
                  kitchen window I stopped paying attention to anything else. It
                  is spectacular and I never fail to feel grateful for the
                  amazing things I see passing by. Thanks so much for the input
                  on my artwork! I really appreciate the feedback, especially
                  from someone with such a good eye for such things. I did a
                  trial run of some greeting cards several years ago and they
                  actually came out quite nicely. I&#8217;ve been toying with
                  the idea of doing it again&#8230; if only to give away to
                  friends and family. (Maybe you&#8217;d be willing to give me
                  some feedback on a few of my other designs?)
