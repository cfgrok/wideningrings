			<h1 id="post-title">Epic Battle</h1>
			<p>In the last few days, all of our lovely, unseasonably cool weather and cloud-filled skies have started to evaporate. Those who know me will understand my disappointment. I am just not a fan of the &#8220;blue sky&#8221; days that are so common here much of the year. What I mean by &#8220;blue sky&#8221;, is exactly what it sounds like â€” nothing but blue&#8230; not even a hint of clouds to break the monotony of that wide expanse. The light is constant, bright and glaring. Ugh!</p>
<p>I like movement in my skies&#8230; I like the way that clouds change and shift the light so that from one moment to the next everything you view is transitioning&#8230; making new shapes, new colors, new moods. In order to console myself a bit I decided to do some vicarious cloud-watching by sifting through my ENDLESS stack of sky images. <em>(Seriously, I could have a blog devoted to nothing but showing pics of the sky every day and I would currently have enough images to last me years and years.) </em></p>
<p>I picked this one out to share with you guys. So, come on&#8230; join in the fun! What do you see in this wonderful sky? What can your imagination turn these fantastic shapes into? (<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don&#8217;t click</span></strong> on the image or read any further until you&#8217;ve got it all worked out in your head!)</p>
<p>Â </p>
<p><a title="cloud shapes" href="/assets/content/20110525/blog_lg-20110525-4075.jpg" target="_blank"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="/assets/content/20110525/blog-20110525-4075.jpg" alt="cloud shapes" width="680" height="510"></a></p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>What I saw was an epic battle between a Great White Shark and a mythical fire-breathing dragon! Can&#8217;t see it for yourself?! OK, go ahead&#8230; <strong>click on the photo</strong> to see my (barely) artistic interpretation. *GRIN*</p>

			<p>I know you stand in solidarity with me on this issue, Ro! Grrrr.. the weather forecast for the next several days isn&#8217;t giving me much reason to be happy&#8230; but, hey, they could be wrong and I&#8217;m focusing all my mental powers on trying to conjure up some serious &#8220;June Gloom&#8221;. ðŸ™‚</p>

			<p>I saw a DRAGON!! Ha, funny (been reading A LOT of dragon books lately with Li). But I saw it in a totally different place. Mine was in the shape of the blue between the clouds and it&#8217;s flying across the sky to the right. Dragon body in center + two wings above + head all the way to the right (like 3/4 up the right side of the frame). I like yours, much more action packed and dramatic. Great shot. Also, I agree. Although I am a great lover of the totally blue sky (which doesn&#8217;t happen all that often in NY) the clouds add a lot of variation and are SO much better for photos. That glaring, direct, super bright light can be a drag. I never wished anyone a cloudy day before&#8230;but&#8230;Harsi, hope you had a nice cloudy day today! B</p>

			<p>Hey, it worked!! Thanks, B&#8230; your wishes brought a few puffy white clouds my way &#8212; thanks, buddy!! I can see if it was a bit of an anomaly how one could look forward to a &#8220;blue sky&#8221; day or two&#8230; but around here it&#8217;s pretty standard for much of summer and fall. And yes, the light is tough to work with photographically. I need to take a page from my friend Ro&#8217;s book and get my butt up early to go outside. That&#8217;s about the only way to get a softer, more even light on things. You have seriously got to stop sharing my brain waves&#8230; I can&#8217;t believe that you saw a dragon too!! Despite your detailed description, I&#8217;m not certain I found your exact dragon&#8230; but, I think I found ANOTHER dragon in the blue sky part. Heh&#8230; it&#8217;s a sky full of dragons, I guess. ðŸ™‚ Ezra told me I should have called this post &#8220;Dragon vs. Shark&#8221;&#8230; but that would have given everything away at the beginning. Plus, I&#8217;m really not sure if anyone other than us has ever seen that indie film from NZ (Eagle vs. Shark), so we&#8217;re probably the only two people that would think it was funny.</p>

			<p>Hah! I saw the same dragon that Ben saw in the negative space of the clouds. What are the odds of that? But I love your interpretation of the shark vs. dragon, and now it&#8217;s so hard to see it as anything else. Sky full of dragons, as you said ðŸ™‚</p>

			<p>Really?!! Another dragon?! That&#8217;s weird, Chris. Weird&#8230; but very cool. I&#8217;m really curious to see the dragons that you guys are seeing&#8230; I&#8217;m going to send you and Ben a copy of the photo and (if either of you is brave enough!) you can try your hand at sketching out your dragon for me to see. ðŸ™‚ This was lots of fun&#8230; expect to see more &#8220;cloud shape&#8221; posts in the future!</p>

			<p>Alright Harsi, I gave it a shot&#8230; but this interpretation really goes to show my lack of artistic ability, haha. Even with a pen tablet it still looks a little lumpy, so use your imagination ðŸ˜‰ <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TvKK6LVpfug/TeAoMpWc1yI/AAAAAAAAEUU/TBo_OxQYNZM/s720/Dragon_clouds2.JPG" rel="nofollow ugc">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TvKK6LVpfug/TeAoMpWc1yI/AAAAAAAAEUU/TBo_OxQYNZM/s720/Dragon_clouds2.JPG</a> Now that I read Ben&#8217;s post again though I&#8217;m not entirely sure we are seeing the same dragon! If so, Ben, I&#8217;d love to see a picture of yours (it can&#8217;t be any worse than mine I&#8217;m sure).</p>

			<p>What do you mean, Chris? That drawing is super cool! I can&#8217;t tell you how much it made my day to have you play along. You&#8217;re the best!!! I&#8217;ve extended the offer to Ben&#8230; we&#8217;ll see if he bites. ðŸ™‚ (BTW, I really, REALLY need to get myself a pen tablet&#8230; I&#8217;m still trying to do all my drawing and Photoshop work with a mouse&#8230; talk about frustrating and clunky!!)</p>

			<p>Ha, Chris! That&#8217;s awesome. How funny that we saw the same thing, Well, kind of. We&#8217;re not seeing exactly the same dragon, but pretty darn close&#8230; OK everyone, no laughing ðŸ™‚ This is more of a Dr. Seuss (we read a lot of him these days too) bird or something. Let&#8217;s say, just some kind of winged creature. And a very happy one too, see the smile? So, maybe that&#8217;s not fire coming out of his mouth. Let&#8217;s say&#8230;he&#8217;s singing.

			<p>Awww, you guys are just the greatest for joining in on the fun! I love your drawing, Ben. It&#8217;s so wonderful to play in this way&#8230; it really lets us all connect with the &#8220;inner kid&#8221; that I&#8217;ve been trying to rediscover lately. I treasure very few possessions&#8230; I guess you could say &#8220;things&#8221; are just not my thing. But, these two little offerings from both of you are really something special&#8230; thank you! ðŸ™‚</p>

			<p>Ben, thanks for sharing! It does look like some sort of seussian creature. How weird is it though that we all saw dragons but in different places? I showed my brother the blank picture and he drew the same dragon that you did Harsi, fire and all (but sans-Shark of course). This is just a sky full of dragons!</p>

			<p>Stranger and stranger, Chris&#8230; I&#8217;m tickled that you got your brother to play along too! Tell him he&#8217;s super cool for finding the same dragon I did. ðŸ™‚</p>
