                in Long Beach. We saw so many fantastic birds, arthropods and
                other critters! I had a really great time&#8230; though after a
                couple hours of walking around, I had to concede that I was a
                tad jealous of how completely r-e-l-a-x-e-d some of the turtles
                looked. *GRIN*

                  Hey girl, Harsi of the hills&#8211; This makes me *grin*
                  *grin* *grin* and I, also, am jealous of that relaxed
                  Trachemys scripta elegan. I can just feel the sun on my back
                  with this photo ðŸ™‚ I love the angle of the turtle&#8217;s
                  head&#8230;I&#8217;m imagining it is saying &#8220;Yeah,
                  I&#8217;m relaxin&#8217;&#8230;.what of it?&#8221; Hope you do
                  something every day this week that leaves you tired and
                  happy&#8230;.just exercised so I am both of those things. And
                  I&#8217;m glad you had fun exploring the park with your
                  friend!

                  Hmmm&#8230; I wonder if I have to change my nickname based on
                  where I&#8217;m out wandering? Somehow &#8220;Harsi of Long
                  Beach&#8221; just doesn&#8217;t have as nice a ring to it!
                  Still, I had a great time getting to meet Chris (outside of
                  our many e-mails) and I too hope that the upcoming week has as
                  much exhausting fun in store for me. Lisa, you would have
                  looooved these turtles! I held back on posting the ones
                  lounging ON TOP of other larger turtles, but it truly was
                  impossible not to smile while watching them. (Maybe I&#8217;ll
                  send you a few bonus pics!) Hopefully, someday I&#8217;ll have
                  a post talking about the fantastic outing the two of us
                  finally have! xo

                  O gosh I hope I have some time to play turtle today. It was
                  really fun seeing you and Ez this weekend, we have to get Lisa
                  out here sometime in the winter when the rattlesnakes are
                  sleeping and snow is falling in NH&#8230; ðŸ™‚ That turtle
                  reminds me of being a kid, swimming all day then laying on the
                  warm concrete, aaaahhhhhhh!

                  Hullo Ro!! I hope you have time to play turtle today
                  too&#8230; Be sure to spend whatever downtime you&#8217;ve got
                  looking up at the magnificent clouds! I couldn&#8217;t resist
                  adding a few more photos to this post for you and Lisa (and
                  everyone else!) to enjoy. While there were plenty of turtles
                  hauling themselves up onto muddy banks and sun-warmed rocks
                  &#8212; most of them congregated on these nifty turtle lounge
                  decks that were floating in the deeper areas of the pond. (I
                  haven&#8217;t thought about laying on warm concrete after
                  getting out of the pool in AGES!!! Thanks for jogging my
                  memory back to something so wonderful.) Oh, and Ez and I had
                  such a great time visiting with you guys on Saturday. We went
                  home with such wonderful things &#8212; a new plate set for
                  us, earrings that I can&#8217;t stop grinning at, and gifts
                  for family &#038; friends! Plus, some killer insect photos
                  from your lush &#038; lovely garden. An excellent day &#8212;
                  thank you Ro! (We will indeed have to coerce Lisa into joining
                  us one of these days.)

                  Hey Harsi! I can&#8217;t help but laugh everytime I look at
                  the top turtle; it looks just so relaxed it&#8217;s
                  ridiculous, haha. Thanks again for coming down here, it was
                  lots of fun ðŸ™‚ Nice bonus turtle in the bottom pic by the
                  way&#8230; I didn&#8217;t know there were anything other than
                  painteds, sliders, and softshells in the lake. Maybe
                  it&#8217;s something like Actinemys marmorata, the Pacific
                  Pond Turtle? Good find whatever it is!

                <p>
                  Chris, the pleasure was all mine! As per our discussion that
                  day about what native turtle populations there might be, I
                  think that the Pacific Pond Turtle might be the only plausible
                  one in this area. I&#8217;d like to believe that&#8217;s what
                  I&#8217;ve photographed here, but it doesn&#8217;t quite seem
                  to match up right with the markings&#8230; perhaps
                  they&#8217;re just quite variable. I have a few better photos
                  I&#8217;ll send you later so that you can muddle over it with
                  me. Between the turtles and that immature Green Heron, there
                  really were a number of surprising (and humorous) moments
                  hanging out by the pond. Great memories, indeed!
                </p>

                  Bonus photos &#8212; lucky for us! Thank you ðŸ™‚ Your # of
                  turtles sunning themselves is far more than I&#8217;ve EVER
                  seen around here in New England&#8230;.I&#8217;ve seen maybe 4
                  at the tops. And yes, Ro! I also love the memory of the warm
                  concrete after swimming&#8230;&#8230;aaaaaahhhhhhhAAAAHHHH!
                  xoxo P.S. If I come visit out there, I may never return here

                  Oh, Lisa, you can&#8217;t even begin to imagine how
                  turtle-rific this place was!!! Not that any of us engaged in a
                  formal survey while we were there, but I have no doubt in my
                  mind that there are HUNDREDS and HUNDREDS of turtles at this
                  park. As I&#8217;ve mentioned, the vast majority of them are
                  introduced species whose populations probably got started by
                  people abandoning their unwanted animals purchased via the pet
                  trade. Obviously&#8230; they have thrived in this habitat. Re:
                  visiting and never returning&#8230; well, I&#8217;m sure WE
                  wouldn&#8217;t mind, but I&#8217;m betting your kids would
                  miss you. xo
