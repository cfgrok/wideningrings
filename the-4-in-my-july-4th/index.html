			<h1 id="post-title">The &#8220;4&#8221; in My July 4th</h1>
			<p>We were driving out of the canyon around 7 o&#8217;clock last night. No holiday plans, just running over to my parents&#8217; place to take care of their dog. We rounded a blind curve that turns onto a straight portion of the road which parallels the seasonal creek. (I shared a picture of <a href="/assets/content/20110514/blog_lg-20110514-6383.jpg" target="_blank">this lovely spot</a> in a previous post.) My husband slowed the truck to a stop&#8230; There, standing squarely in the middle of the road â€” looking like a large, shaggy road block â€” was an adult <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_black_bear" target="_blank">California Black Bear <em>Ursus americanus californiensis)</em></a>. Always an amazing thing to see at such close range, but our delight grew as it became quickly apparent that she was not alone. One. Two. THREE! Three incredible little cubs! A typical litter is two cubs and it was our first time seeing more than that. I had my camera with me and there was ample opportunity to photograph out the window as the adult first crossed to one side of the road and then thought better of it and padded back towards the creek with her cubs trailing behind. Unfortunately, it was late enough that the tree canopy was not affording much light and I could quickly see that my slow shutter speed was going to mean somewhat blurry images. I decided to switch to shooting video and ended up with a lovely little film clip to remember the moment. Despite the technical imperfection of the first few images, I ended up really liking the surreal, dream-like feel of them. But, they didn&#8217;t tell the story of the bears crossing the road, so I put together a series of still images from the video too. </p>

<p>Â </p>
<p>I called my neighbors later to tell them about the sighting and they responded that they had seen the same family much earlier in the afternoon at the same point on the road. (The creek attracts animals year round, but with the current heat wave the wildlife is even more keen to seek out the dense shade and remaining stands of water.) I am hopeful that I may get to see this family again as Summer progresses&#8230; But, you never know about these things, so we watched them until they had completely disappeared from sight and there was nothing more than the twitching of leaves where they had passed into the dense foliage. Aloud, I wished her and her cubs success and safe travels. I said a silent &#8220;thank you&#8221; and smiled to myself.</p>

			<p>How fortunate to see them from your car, what a great photo op! Now that I have to go out so early I never know who I might run into. They are often up Palmer canyon as well because of the water. Glad you&#8217;re feeling better!</p>

			<p>Hey there, Ro! This was actually just at about the same spot in the road where we saw those young deer crossing when we were out walking together &#8212; you know, just before the point where those newts were mating? Can you imagine what we would have done if it had been a bear and her cubs that day??! Ezra and I had this very thought as we often walk that path at sundown. Actually, we&#8217;ve only seen a bear ONCE when not in the relative safety of the cabin or our vehicle. It was on the far side of the creek from us and not at all concerned with our presence, but it still made me feel rather vulnerable and exposed. I keep saying that I should buy a small air horn to tote around with me in case I encounter a bear or mountain lion unexpectedly on the trail&#8230; but, I&#8217;ve yet to do that. I hope you DO get to see some bear on one of your future morning walks&#8230; though, at a safe distance, preferably. ðŸ™‚ XO P.S. I am soooo glad to be feeling better too! Thanks.</p>

			<p>I do carry an air horn. I purchased it after a bear encounter that was too close for comfort. In retrospect it was exciting but also terrifying. I&#8217;ve also seen mountain lions and this time of year it&#8217;s anyones guess what might be around the next corner. I have seen bear several times. So far all the big predators have been just as afraid of me as I have been of them.</p>

			<p>Oh! I had no idea that you encountered bear so frequently. And next time we see each other you simply must tell me about your experiences seeing mountain lion and about this close call bear encounter!! I have yet to see a lion for myself, but would love to&#8230; ideally at a distance that was just great enough to keep me from being terrified, but not so far away as to preclude getting a few photos. *GRIN* I am relieved to hear that the bears and lions you&#8217;ve run into seem wary &#8212; best way to keep both them and us safe.</p>
