                No tricks with this one! Nothing mirrored, flipped, reversed,
                altered or otherwise manipulated. What you see is simply a
                cropped poriton of a larger photo. It looked so otherworldly to
                me today that I wondered how recognizable it would be without
                the surrounding context.

                  my first thought was a droplet on a leaf.. happy to see I
                  guess right. Exquisite details and I love the marbled effect
                  within the drop&#8211; reminds me of our planet in a way, only
                  everything is beautifully green ðŸ™‚

                  Hello, fellow night owl&#8230; I&#8217;m so happy that you
                  also saw a planet!! Not Earth, but some other place that
                  simply must be teeming with life, yes?! I also saw a
                  stone&#8230; a beautiful quartz or agate, polished smooth and
                  shiny. As I recall, the lighting for this and a few other
                  photos I took was really interesting&#8230; It was last May
                  and I was in my mother-in-law&#8217;s garden and it had been
                  raining and cloudy. Then, the sun started to burn its way
                  through, but hadn&#8217;t quite managed to get glare-y yet.
                  I&#8217;m sure you know exactly what I mean. *GRIN* BTW,
                  Cindy, that is a really wonderful quotation you just put up on
                  your blog. I also am dying to know what kind of cats those
                  are?! WOW. Talk about a spectacular photo!!

                  ah yes, a polished stone. I saw the same, but I really
                  shouldn&#8217;t be commenting on blogs after editing photos
                  for 2 hours ðŸ˜‰ I&#8217;m just in love with those greens. And
                  those splendid caterpillars are Milkweed Tussock Moths &#8211;
                  (Euchaetes egle) I found hundreds of them in a small stand of
                  milkweed. I could spend hours and hours in milkweed, it
                  attracts so many interesting insects.. that and the blossoms
                  smell just divine. Speaking of night owls, Garry re-found a
                  &#8216;game ear&#8217; he bought years ago- a little dohickey
                  you wear in your ear that magnifies sounds. Wow. It&#8217;s
                  incredible what I&#8217;m hearing out there now, on top of the
                  usual night sounds. I had something up in the large oak near
                  my bedroom just chowing away on green acorns. I could hear
                  every *crunch*. Only problem is now I want night-vision
                  goggles so I can see what&#8217;s up there feeding away ðŸ™‚

                  Hundreds did you say??!! So many of those beautiful
                  caterpillars in one place. Man o&#8217; man&#8230; I can only
                  imagine, Cindy. *grin* That&#8217;s a memory that money
                  can&#8217;t buy, and medicine that no doctor can provide.
                  Sadly, we don&#8217;t seem to have much milkweed growing in
                  this part of the canyon. I&#8217;ve found a patch here and
                  there, but not seemingly enough to host too much insect life.
                  When Ez and I first started birdwatching, I remember really
                  wanting to try one of those ear pieces out in the field&#8230;
                  but, we never did. How interesting to know that it actually
                  works. I might just have to get myself one! Green
                  acorns&#8230; we&#8217;ve got them too. Who do you suspect was
                  snacking on them? Re: the night vision goggles&#8230; When we
                  first moved into our cabin, I was actually given a gift of a
                  pair. I think they were pretty high quality, but despite that
                  fact I found them very difficult to use (my overly small head
                  might have been part of the problem) and the quality of the
                  image just didn&#8217;t seem worth it. We ended up returning
                  them&#8230; just thought I&#8217;d mention my experience if
                  you were serious about getting a pair. (Make sure
                  there&#8217;s a decent return policy, just in case.)

                  yeah, the milkweed tussock cats can demolish a huge stand of
                  milkweed in record time- virtual eating machines. I
                  can&#8217;t grow milkweed back here in the woods, so I have to
                  seek out open fields and sunny areas to find any.. and when I
                  do I never want to leave, there&#8217;s so much going on
                  there. It grows well along disturbed roadside beds, so any
                  trip we take takes quite awhile to get there, since I want to
                  see what&#8217;s on every plant. Walker carries a huge line of
                  game ears- I posted about it in my status on facebook and I
                  heard back from quite a few birders that use them.. no wonder
                  Phoebe is always at the windows looking out into the dark if
                  her hearing is that good ðŸ™‚ We&#8217;ve got so many critters
                  here that it would be hard to guess what&#8217;s eating the
                  acorns.. &#8216;possums, &#8216;coons, porcupine, flying
                  squirrels.. bear might even find them tasty, not sure- and we
                  do have gray fox, which can climb trees. I stopped trying to
                  bait for moths, put out a huge overripe watermelon and the
                  entire thing was gone the next day! They didn&#8217;t even
                  leave a seed behind. I won&#8217;t bother to slice it for them
                  next time, I made it too easy for the critters to carry it
                  away ðŸ™‚

                  Love this shot. The droplet is so metallic looking, like a
                  spot of liquid tin-lead solder (from my audio circuit welding
                  days). Cool how so much is contained within that droplet. The
                  reflection from the expansive sky above is reduced to a tiny
                  point. While the detail of the leaf below is magnified. All
                  mixed up in one. Ben

                  ~ Cindy ~ &#8220;It grows well along disturbed roadside beds,
                  so any trip we take takes quite awhile to get there, since I
                  want to see what&#8217;s on every plant.&#8221; Hmmm&#8230;
                  the few plants I&#8217;ve been able to find are right along
                  the road too. Thanks for the tip, I&#8217;ll look for it in a
                  few other spots. So funny&#8230; imagining you needing to stop
                  and check out every plant! That is why very few people like
                  going out walking with me&#8230; I cannot resist inspecting
                  all the small things along the trail. *grin* I always thrill
                  to hear about your wildlife, C! Oh, man, that watermelon story
                  is a good one. Even the seeds, eh??! *GRIN* I&#8217;ve never
                  even seen a porcupine or flying squirrel before, though I
                  would love to! (They do have flying squirrels on the island in
                  WA, so maybe soon!) Thanks again for the info about the
                  hearing device&#8230; I&#8217;ll check it out.

                  ~ Ben ~ Hullo!!! I wondered if you would dig this one&#8230; I
                  do so love the look of things when the sky brightens just
                  after some rain. (These were poppy leaves, BTW.) Yes&#8230;
                  &#8220;metallic&#8221; is a very good word! Thank you, I was
                  searching for a similar descriptive. I loved your comment
                  about what the drop contains and the mixing of elements! I am
                  constantly in awe of the transformative powers of light. Being
                  photographers, (both you and Cindy) you probably will remember
                  that there was a time when you did not immediately notice the
                  light, or if you did it was in a vague and passing way. But,
                  once you begin to spend time behind the lens, it becomes
                  difficult NOT to be acutely aware of what the light is doing
                  at all times&#8230; admiring its qualities, watching its
                  behavior. As though it had a spirit and life of its own&#8230;
                  and perhaps it does, eh?
