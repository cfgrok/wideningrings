                As we were driving out of the canyon on Sunday — on our way to
                <a href="/relaxin-weekend" target="_blank"
                  >our destination in Long Beach</a
                >
                — we arrived at a flat area of open fields and low brush (same
                spot as in
                <a href="/good-morning-nope-great-morning" target="_blank"
                  >this post</a
                >) where we have observed several quail couples regularly
                foraging for the last few months. It&#8217;s been my experience
                that in the late Summer, Fall, and Winter months,

                travel in typically large groups (known as coveys), but
                beginning in early Spring, they start pairing off and the
                couples seem quite inseparable from that point on. As we slowed
                to allow one such pair to cross the road, I was delighted to see
                four little chicks scurrying between their legs! These are the
                first babies I&#8217;ve seen this season, and though I had to
                take these so-so pictures through the front windshield, the
                results are still undeniably cute! (Click on any image for a
                slightly embiggened view.)

                  Recently I visited my brother (Rick)and his wife (Carol) in
                  Aiken, South Carolina. I found a nest with baby mockingbirds
                  in it right outside the bedroom window of their old (new to
                  them) farmhouse. Carol had just said &#8220;What are THOSE
                  birds?&#8221;, pointing to some adult mockingbirds. I told her
                  and described their great repertoire of sounds to her. (She is
                  one that wakes in the night to every little sound and cannot
                  get back to sleep.) I didn&#8217;t have the heart to tell her
                  what she may be in for&#8230;&#8230; Would you have told her?
                  (!) P.S. Love your word &#8220;embiggened.&#8221; 🙂

                  Hello, Lisa-bird! No, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have said
                  anything either. If the birds were going to end up waking her
                  in the middle of the night, there wouldn&#8217;t be much they
                  could do about it, so why bring up a negative? Perhaps
                  she&#8217;ll get lucky and they won&#8217;t disturb her at
                  all&#8230; It&#8217;s very strange that you would bring up
                  baby mockingbirds in this post. Perhaps you are picking up on
                  my psychic vibrations&#8230; You see, part of the reason I
                  wanted to focus on these adorable (and well-cared for) little
                  ones is that on the same day I had a really heart-breaking
                  experience. When we were returning home from Long Beach, we
                  stopped in downtown Claremont to run an errand. As we pulled
                  into a parking space, before we even got out of the truck, I
                  noticed a pitiful site &#8212; a newly fledged mockingbird
                  standing perfectly still on the sidewalk near the side of a
                  building. It was obviously petrified, with no cover or shelter
                  of any kind to duck into and an endless stream of people (many
                  of whom were walking their dogs!) coming within a foot or so
                  of the poor bird. Everyone seemed completely oblivious to its
                  presence, which I suppose was for the best. Now, common sense
                  wisdom dictates that you shouldn&#8217;t move a young bird you
                  find on the ground because the parents probably know
                  it&#8217;s there and will come back to feed it. We could see
                  and hear the parents in the tall trees overhead, but leaving
                  the juvenile so exposed with so much foot traffic was not
                  tolerable. I decided to move it across the street (where the
                  parents were currently perching) into a raised planter box so
                  that it would be off the ground. The box was densely planted
                  with shrubs and I hoped that would provide some nice cover. I
                  wasn&#8217;t sure if the bird was going to struggle, but when
                  I used a cloth shopping bag to scoop it up, there was no
                  resistance whatsoever. The bird was already beginning to grow
                  its flight feathers and did not outwardly seem to be
                  injured&#8230; but certainly very stunned, and likely quite
                  scared. As I placed the long-legged, immobile little bundle
                  under some foliage, I sighed deeply and made a fervent wish
                  that somehow this would have a happy ending. Walking away from
                  situations like that is always so painful for me. I tell
                  myself I&#8217;ve done all that I can&#8230; but, I want to do
                  something more. I know it&#8217;s just part of the whole cycle
                  of things that some babies don&#8217;t make it. Oh, but
                  I&#8217;m far too tender-hearted for my own good. 🙁 Re:
                  embiggened&#8230; I gather this word was actually coined a
                  long, long time ago. However, along with much of the current
                  populace, I was re-introduced to this word via an episode of
                  &#8220;The Simpsons&#8221; several years ago. I think
                  it&#8217;s fun to say and I love using it in this context. xo
